title: Hello World

Hello, folks.

I've taken some time recently to share my concerns, publicly and privately, over the rise of global tyranny during the so-called "COVID-19 pandemic."

The actions taken over the past eight months are clearly leading to the destruction of the economy and the crushing of the human spirit.

Most people seem to believe that these are mere side-effects of well-intentioned efforts by our government. However, there's a great deal of evidence which indicates otherwise.

Over the past few months, I've written speeches, reports, and blog posts that I have yet to publish. In my heart of hearts, I'd love to take on this cause full-time. I believe deeply in the capacity of the human species and don't want it to fall under the yoke of tyrants. It seems to me that we are closer to enslavement than we have ever been in my lifetime.

However, I have a business to get off the ground, and it seems that most people would rather not hear a viewpoint which dissents from that of the mainstream media. 

As much as I'd like to claim that I am Iron Man, impervious to all assaults, physical and emotional, the truth is that to be a full-time "champion of the people" takes an incredible amount of emotional energy, a sum that I do not feel capable of devoting while my business is not yet fully established.

If you are in the minority of people who also smell a rat, but don't know who to turn to, I'd like you to know that you are not alone. There are many others just like you out there. Seek them out. They will be glad to have you.

How can it be that the average person is blind to the truth? 

Some don't care to know.

Others know, but don't want to confront the horror.

Others know, but don't want to be shunned by their peers.

Remember that humans have a natural instinct to operate as a herd. This instinct has been carefully exploited for decades.

My only hope is that enough people wake up before we lose our freedom and our property rights. 

Orwell cautioned us that there is a state from which the citizenry has no escape, a situation where an oppressive government has the people in a complete and total chokehold. It's my firm belief that we are dangerously close to such a situation.

My grandparents come from North Korea, and were sure to teach us about how "paradisal" it is to live there. The shifts currently occurring in American government, education, and culture, do not bode well. Secondly, I've spoken with friends who have lived under former Soviet Union governments, and they are also ringing the alarm bell. Thirdly, a Sikh friend of mine told me that he has been very concerned about the trajectory that we are on, explaining that, coming from a part of the world where the "rule of law" is not a given, he and his family have been much more critical of the COVID-19 response than they would have otherwise been. 

Please consider that if your family has lived under the rule of a Western democracy for generations that you may not have been primed for the possibility that the guardians of the people might one day turn on them.

Regardless of your political affiliation, I urge you to read Orwell's 1984 and to consider how we might prevent such a situation from occurring.

Thank you.

Programming is the vocation I've chosen for myself.

Traditionally, the very first program each new programmer learns to implement is known as "Hello World."

What is "Hello World?"

Hello world is known as the simplest program that actually does something that the user can see.

Thank you for reading. 

I'll be posting a series of articles on how to learn to program.

My team and I are currently working on an educational programming game.

We grew up on educational games on the computer which helped to cultivate a love of computing. We'd like to share this tradition with you, the next generation.
