## A World in Crisis

Hello, friends. We are living in historic times.

Before the COVID-19 lockdowns, I spent very little of my time and attention on politics and world affairs, thinking of it as an icky thing that other people can worry themselves with.

However, governmentally-imposed loss of freedom, contradictory media stories, and sharp [rise in censorship][52] quickly captured my attention, causing me to ask, "What's really going on here?"

And so, I've spent a great deal of time over the past several months trying to understand how the world came to be in its current state, where it's going, and what action that we, as a civilization, should undertake in order to keep humanity on a sane path.

I make no claims to be a great philosopher or leader of men. However, I swear that I have come to the following conclusions after much research and deliberation, and will provide several references so that you can perform your own analysis.

Before I get into the main point, I'd like to tell you a story about disinformation.

You may have witnessed dietary advice recently shift from "fat is bad" to "sugar is bad."

How did we get it so wrong last time?

It turns out that the sugar industry [paid off][50] two researchers, using "approximately **$50,000** in today's dollars."

Can you imagine the **decades of harm** that $50,000 dollars caused? The millions of people affected by health issues from following *deliberately* sabotaged health guidelines?

What's worse, a [2016 study published in JAMA][51] finds that we aren't free of corrupt scientific inquiry, asking, "Is it really true that food companies deliberately set out to manipulate research in their favor? Yes, it is, and the practice continues."

The study concludes, "Policymaking committees should consider giving less weight to food industry-funded studies." 

Importantly, there is no reason to believe that the food industry is the only industry guilty of funding biased studies.

## 9/11 & GWOT

Never forget the dozens of bloody, crying firemen who screamed about the bombs in the towers and the lobby before and after the planes hit.
Never forget the 2,300,000,000,000 dollars that was reported missing by Donald Rumsfeld the day before 9/11.
Never forget that the controller in charge of the Pentagon's budget was Doc Zakheim who lost the 2.3 trillion dollars by doing poor book keeping (lost 1.55 billion dollars, per day, for five years....)
Never forget that Dov Zakheim was also the CEO of Systems Planning Corporation in 2001 which manufactures Flight Termination Systems for commercial airliners so they can be remotely controlled by computers.
Never forget that the day after Rumsfeld mentioned missing 2.3 trillion dollars, a plane impacted the Office of Naval Intelligence at the Pentagon where the computers were kept which stored that information....over 100 budget analysts and accountants were killed and the money trail was lost.
Never forget that Larry Silverstein bought the entire WTC center lease in 2000 for a 15 million dollar bid (even though he was LOWER than other bidders).
Never forget that Larry Silverstein put a 3.5 BILLION dollar insurance policy on the towers against terrorist attacks in June 2001.....then 3 months later, both towers get hit by aircraft.
Never forget that Larry Silverstein sued his insurers (over 40 companies) to get paid double his limit, since each plane constitutes a separate attack...and never forget that Larry made 4.55 billion dollars so far, off of an initial investment of 15 million dollars.
Never forget that scientists and physicists at BYU found a type of explosive in every dust sample tested which was confirmed to be a type of Thermite. (Thermite produces liquid iron and is used to cut thick columns effectively and quietly).
Never forget that World Trade Center 7 fell at 5:20pm on 9/11 and the news tried to cover it up.
Never forget that BBC, fox news and CNN reporters all misread scripts live on TV which announced WTC7 collapsing hours before it did.....indicating a prewritten narrative.
Never forget that WTC 7 was 47 stories tall, yet NIST said that it collapsed "at free fall acceleration for 2.25 seconds".
Never forget high school physics and the definition of static equilibrium and conservation of momentum which would make it impossible for any structure to collapse at FREE FALL acceleration (impossible with out explosives or pre-weakening the structure)
Never forget the US government was warned over 50 times about by at least 12 countries of an imminent terrorist attack, which were all ignored.
Never forget that when Bush and Cheney met with 9/11 Comission, they did so only on their own terms:
-They appeared together
-They were not under oath
-No press or family members were allowed to attend
-No recording of any kind was allowed
Never forget that NORAD was running two drills on 9/11:. Vigilant Guardian and Vigilant Warrior.
Never forget that these drills scrambled jets all over the country, and over the ocean and made it impossible for the pilots to intercept the hijacked jets in time once they were scrambled towards the hijackings.
Never forget NORAD interceptions on 9/11 took 80 minutes to scramble, too late to do anything. The average time is 10 minutes.
Never forget that In 2000, NORAD had 67 intercepts with 100% accuracy. On 9/11 they failed 4 times in one day.
Never forget that molten metal was found at ground zero weeks after the towers collapsed, and was also found under WTC7. And never forget that Kerosene and office furniture doesn't burn hot enough to phase change steel from solid to liquid. It was never mentioned in official reports.
Never forget that a van was pulled over trying to leave new York city, and contained illegal explosives and very suspicious occupants from Israel who were detained for 71 days, and then this story disappeared.
Never forget that no video has ever been released showing a plane hitting the pentagon despite having 85 external cameras that could have captured the footage.
Never forget that eye witnesses and first responders at the pentagon reported no plane wreckage.
Never forget that over 80 surveillance and CCTV videos from local businesses were gathered by FBI agents within 15 minutes of the crash. That footage has never been released.
Never forget the “terrorists” passports that were miraculously found untouched amongst the rubble.
Never forget that at least 7 of the 19 “hijackers” are still alive and the FBI has still not updated its list. At least 5 are listed as connected to US military institutions.
Never forget that eye witnesses and first responders reported no plane wreckage or bodies in the Pennsylvania field where flight 93 supposedly crashed.
Never forget that since that day over 30 professional pilots have tried to recreate the alleged path the plane took before striking the pentagon in a flight simulator...all have failed.
Never forget the thousands of lives lost that day, and the tens of thousands since… murdered by a small handful of people for money and power.
The people who have lost their lives deserve the truth.

Remember 9/11? 

I do. I was 13 at the time. I remember watching the towers fall perfectly symmetrically after planes had hit each one, leaving highly asymmetrical damage near the very top of the building.

I remember asking myself, "WTF? How could a total, symmetrical collapse occur after a small amount of damage was sustained at the top of the building?"

But I looked around at my friends and family and they told me, "They would never lie to us!" 

So, I pushed through my cognitive dissonance and went with the group. These were really smart people! My friends and family couldn't ALL be wrong... right?

And so, I attended the patriotic memorial services and was in awe of the "United we stand" messages that were posted everywhere.

Congress passed the Patriot Act. It seemed to me like knee-jerk reaction, like these heart-broken senators and congressmen were overwhelmed with grief for their fallen countrymen and felt that, in such a situation, it was OK to **temporarily** grant over-reaching surveillance powers to law enforcement. 

(The Patriot Act was meant to last for four years.)

### Bamboozled

Looks like the joke was on us.

Here we are, nearly 20 years later, and we never found any WMDs in Iraq, 801,000 are dead, and we've [spent $6.4 trillion][38], no end in sight.

Not only is the "temporary" Patriot Act still in effect, we've grossly [expanded federal law enforcement][57], founded a [combat command dedicated to North America][56], and [killed habeus corpus][37].

### Punishment of Critics

When I look back, were there people who smelled a rat at the time?

There were.

Around the world, many [large demonstrations][59] were held around the world, protesting the Iraq War as an [oil grab][58].

These demonstrations, even those held in the United States, were dismissed as the actions of a ["vocal minority"][60].

Indeed, it was not politically wise to speak out against the war in the early days.

You may remember that many critics were shut down for speaking out against the narrative presented by the Bush administration and the media. That these people were labeled "unpatriotic, heartless, and unsympathetic" to the families who had lost their loved ones in this terrifying, hateful act.

Several journalists critical of the Bush Administration were [placed on a "selectee" list][62] for additional airport screenings. News stories about this list indicate that political opposition to the regime is the only requirement for admittance.

Some individuals critical of 9/11 and the NDAA have even been [placed on the No Fly List][65], seemingly for political reasons.

### Truth

#### Engineered for Jet impact


> The building was designed to have a fully loaded 707 crash into it. That was the largest plane at the time. I believe that the building probably could sustain multiple impacts of jetliners because this structure is like the mosquito netting on your screen door -- this intense grid -- and the jet plane is just a pencil puncturing that screen netting. It really does nothing to the screen netting.

#### Contradictory Information

Most interestingly, there was an incredible amount of contradictory information and redacted testimony.

"It looked like a controlled demolition." "Just kidding, it wasn't."
"Flight 11 is still in the air!" "No, flight 11 crashed."
"WTC-7 has collapsed already!" "No, it didn't collapsed until 10 minutes later"

If they have nothing to hide, why are they hiding everything? Why are they hiding audiotapes of FAA and NORAD controllers? Why are they hiding videotapes of whatever hit the Pentagon? Why are they hiding the black boxes? Why did they destroy most of the forensic evidence which appears to show that three buildings at the World Trade Center were brought down by thermite demolition charges? The above are but a tiny fraction of the unanswered questions not even raised by those who “investigated” the 9/11 tragedy. The most unbelievable of all the conspiracy theories surrounding 9/11 is the OFFICIAL conspiracy theory told us by our government.”

#### Five Dancing Israelis

1. Rapid onset of destruction
2.  Destruction occurred at near free-fall pace
3.  Destruction followed path of greatest resistance
4.  Perimeter column steel ejected laterally up to 500 feet
5.  Blast waves blew out windows 400 ft away
6.  118 first responders report explosions at onset of destruction
7.  Numerous eyewitness reports of flowing molten metal in rubble
8.  Mid-air pulverization of concrete with outward-arching plumes
9.  Rapid expansion & pyroclastic flow of enormous dust clouds
10. Squibs: explosive ejections 40 stories below impact zone
11. Total dismemberment of steel core column structures
12. 1200 ft diameter symmetrical debris field
13. Chemical evidence of thermate on steel and in dust samples
14. FEMA steel analysis: sulfidation, oxidation & intergranular melting
15. No precedent for steel frame highrise collapse coaused by fire

# Medical Industry: A History of Malpractice

> "Never let a crisis to go to waste" 
> -- Rahm Emanuel

Until recently, I didn't know much about the vaccine industry, but the recent insistence that we ALL stay in our homes and don't develop natural immunity to the virus and wait around until we are innoculated with a vaccine made me very curious.

## Bill Gates: Crimes Against Humanity?

<center> 
<img src="../images/2020/09/covid-1984/BillGates.jpg" width="500"/> </center>
<center> </center>

Sara Cunial, an Italian MP, accused Bill Gates of "Crimes Against Humanity" in an [impassioned speech in the Italian parliament][97] this May.

Why is this?

## Gates on COVID vaccine

"governments will have to be involved because there will be some risk and indemnification needed.”

## Gates

Interestingly, Bill Gates has recently been calling for indemnification from the governments of the world.

Since he's been funding vaccinations around the globe for some time now, and Business Insider writes that he is funding [seven different factories][87] for the manufacture of a COVID-19 vaccine.

So, I thought I'd look into some of the track record of his organizations.

### Africa: DTP

Diphtheria, Tetanus, and pertussis

Bobby Kennedy: 
"no longer being used in USA. Still used in Africa.

In a 2017 study funded by the Danish International Development Agency and the Novo Nordisk foundation found that infants given the DTP (Diptheria-Tetanus-Pertussis) vaccine experienced a [5x mortality rate][11] versus un-vaccinated children.

This vaccine was [dropped by western nations in in 1990s][75], "following thousands of reports of death and brain damage,"

but, according to their 2018 Annual report, GAVI (a Gates-backed "global alliance for vaccines and immunization") was still administering three doses of DTP vaccine to African youth, claiming a coverage of 64 million african children. [76]

## Kenya

"We are not convinced that the government has taken adequate responsibility to ensure that Tetanus Toxoid vaccine (TT) laced with Beta human chorionic gonadotropin (b-HCG) sub unit is not being used by the sponsoring development partners. This has previously been used by the same partners in Philippines, Nicaragua and Mexico to vaccinate women against future pregnancy. Beta HCG sub unit is a hormone necessary for pregnancy." 

"When injected as a vaccine to a non-pregnant woman, this Beta HCG sub unit combined with tetanus toxoid develops antibodies against tetanus and HCG so that if a woman’s egg becomes fertilized, her own natural HCG will be destroyed rendering her permanently infertile. In this situation tetanus vaccination has been used as a birth control method." - [Kenya][14]


> Is there a tetanus crisis in Kenya? If this is so, why has it not been declared?
> Why does the campaign target women of 14 – 49years?
> Why has the campaign left out young girls, boys and men even if they are all prone to tetanus?
> In the midst of so many life threatening diseases in Kenya, why has tetanus been prioritized?

2:

> We sent six samples from around Kenya to laboratories in South Africa. They tested positive for the HCG antigen. They were all laced with HCG.
> 
> This proved right our worst fears; that this WHO campaign is not about eradicating neonatal tetanus but a well-coordinated forceful population control mass sterilization exercise using a proven fertility regulating vaccine. This evidence was presented to the Ministry of Health before the third round of immunization but was ignored.

3:

> Either we are lying or the government is lying. But ask yourself, ‘What reason do the Catholic doctors have for lying?’ The Catholic Church has been here in Kenya providing health care and vaccinating for 100 years for longer than Kenya has existed as a country.
> 
> Usually we give a series three shots over two to three years, we give it anyone who comes into the clinic with an open wound, men, women or children. If this is intended to inoculate children in the womb, why give it to girls starting at 15 years? You cannot get married till you are 18.
> -- Dr. Muhame Ngare of the Mercy Medical Centre in Nairobi


 "even before FP2020, Depo-Provera was already the most widely used contraceptive in many sub-Saharan African countries. Nevertheless, studies had indicated that there were risks. DMPA, the active ingredient in Depo, had been linked with loss of bone density, significant menstrual irregularities, and an increased risk of breast cancer. More troubling, especially for countries with high HIV rates, was some early evidence that DMPA may increase a user's risk of acquiring HIV."
 - [PSMag][27]

### India: 490K Paralysis

paralysis between 2000 and 2017 - oral polio vaccine (OPV)

A study published in the International journal of Environmental Research and Public Health found that:

The correlation between trailing 5-years vaccine doses with the incidence of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis was extremely strong with an R-value of (0.76) p value < 0.001.

Their research strongly suggests that 490,000 vaccinated Indian youth developed paralysis as a result of polio vaccination. 

They conclude, very diplomatically, "that this finding will help continue efforts at optimizng the dose schedule of [polio vaccine] administration  and result in a reduction in [paralysis]."

[Indian paralysis][19] 

2017 - [Indian govt reduces Gates Foundation immunization funding] [18]

Why reduce funding if it's working?

### Indemnification

## 1970s Swine Flu immunization

hopes to immunize "every man, woman, and child."

The first was later in 1976, when instead of boxes of bottled vaccine, the vaccine manufacturers delivered an ultimatum—that the federal government indemnify them against claims of adverse reactions as a requirement for release of the vaccines. The government quickly capitulated to industry's demand for indemnification.

"NIIP administered a program that immunized 45 million in 10 weeks, which resulted in doubling the level of immunization for persons deemed to be at high risk, rapidly identifying adverse effects, and developing and administering an informed consent form for use in a community-based program."


## 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act


1980s vaccine industry comes to congress, asks for bailout.
They were getting HAMMERED by lawsuits!!!
"We can't afford to be in business"
Congress bailed them out.

Government then took up the responsibility for vaccination. Promised to perform safety studies every 2 years.

According to Dr. Rashid Buttar, "Number of safety studies conducted: 0"

No liability. Guaranteed income.
**Defendant is now: HHS!!!**
**DOJ defends HHS!!!**

Fighting our own government because we've been injured by something that THEY'VE mandated.
NO LIABILITY.

1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act
[wikipedia][6]

"... so the industry got together and manufacturers said, holy cow, now we have a product that has no liability, and that’s the biggest cost for drugs.
o they said, number one, we don’t have to test it, that’s a huge cost avoided.  Number two, there’s no liability and that’s the biggest cost avoided.  Number three, there’s no marketing or advertising costs, because it’s mandated.  So it’s just like printing money."

" you can get a vaccine on the CDC’s recommended schedule it averages about a billion dollars annually in pure profits for your company .  When I was a kid I got three vaccines and was fully compliant and today’s kids get 72 vaccines."

- Bobby Kennedy, Jr.

# Media

As it turns out, the media has been lying to us for a long time.

## Communist Propaganda

<img src="../images/2020/09/covid-1984/MaoPoster.jpg" width="500"/> 

In America, we take it for granted that those poor SOBs in Russia and China have to live with government-controlled media, which is actively feeding propaganda to its citizens.

We even like to chuckle at the communist propaganda posters, which are almost comical in how grandiose they are.

## Neutrality of Media

In modern America, we are raised to believe that journalism is objective and unbiased.

However, this is unique to our country during recent history. 
In Russia, for example, XYZZY

In older times in the USA, newspapers were known to have a bias.

### Human Weakness: Conformity

We often hear that humans are "herd animals." That we are the "average of the five people we spend the most time with."

Most of us have an instinct to fit in, and this has been [well-studied and exploited][53].

One of the most dangerous effects of this instinct is when we [DISREGARD our own judgment][54] due to [group pressure][55]. 

I've caved to groupthink several times, myself. And I'm not proud of it.

There is significant evidence that the following deaths may have been assassinations:

* Jeff Bradstreet: Vaccine Researcher who [shot himself in chest and jumped into the river][73]
* Seth Rich: DNC staffer, killed in a ["mugging"][76] where his posessions were not taken.

As we know, "Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself." 

Perhaps not all "heart attacks" and "apparent suicides" are what they seem.

#### Crematoriums

Jeff Berwick, an American expatriate, personally drove to Mexico City after
seeing news stories on TV about Mexico City crematoriums being overrun with bodies, and smoke stacks constantly burning. When he arrived, he encountered facilities with no obvious sign of activity, a lone security guard wearing a mask, and yellow caution tape advising people to stay away.

# Escalating violence

**Chicago Sun-Times**: year-on-year homicides up 139% 

**NYC** - July: 177% increase in shootings

**Bellingham** - burglaries up 90% for April-June YOY.

### Election Violence

Rasmussen poll: 62% of voters believe it is at least "somewhat likely" the Far Left will commit acts of violence if Trump is reelected.

[just over 20 percent of both Democratic and Republican respondents believe][15] violence is at least somewhat justified if their side loses the election.


# Monetary Problems

## Job Counts

**Fresh unemployment claims increased to 1.43 million last week — the 19th consecutive week in which claims exceeded one million — crushing all existing records.**

Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, the previous record for weekly unemployment filings was 695,000 in 1982. 

2008 crisis had filings in the five-and-six-hundred thousands, totalling 37M claims. Good thing we haven't hit that, right?

Oh wait:

**More than 55 million Americans have sought jobless benefits since state shutdowns began in mid-March.**

A May 19 article in Forbes reports that:

April unemployment report posted rate of 14.7%, up from 4.4%
It is estimated that unemployment hit 24.9% during the Great Depression.
Including marginally attached job seekers [pushes the rate to 27.6%][10] 

* is currently not in the labor force
* wants full-time work
* has actively looked for a job sometime in the past 12 months
* Not currently actively looking

## Consumer Confidence

Understandably, the U.S. consumer confidence index dropped to 92.6 in July, down from 98.3 in June. This reading lower than the estimated 94.5 for July. 

"consumers have grown less optimistic about the short-term outlook for the economy and labor market and remain subdued about their financial prospects."  

## GDP

Numbers I've seen for GDP decline during the Great Depression vary from approximately 30% to 45%, over a 4-year period, from 1929 to 1933.

How are we doing so far, now that we are about five months into what seems to be the greatest depression since the Great Depression?

Well, the numbers from Q2 are in, finding that

[for April-June, the US economy has contracted at 33% annual rate, the worst economic drop on record][12]

Personal consumption — down 34.6%, annualized
Services — travel, tourism, restaurants, etc. — down 43.5%
Business investment — down 37.7%
New housing — down 38.7%
Exports — down 64%
Federal government spending — from a reduced tax base — up 17%.

In a quarter of record GDP contraction... and record unemployment… disposable personal income skyshot 42.1%, again annualized.

Joel Naroff, of Naroff Economic Advisers:
“The only way you have personal income rising in a collapsing economy is if you turn to a massive welfare economy.”

## Covid Relief

Speaking of welfare economy, thank heavens for the CARES act! Imagine how bleak things would be without that additional federal aid.

I hate to break it to you, but the [CARES act benefits are drying up.][13]

* Unemployment benefits are set to fall 65% for the average person after July 31, when the $600-a-week boost expires. 
* Some will see a much sharper drop. In Oklahoma, there would be a 93% drop to $44 a week, according to most recent Labor Department data. 

## Inflation Concerns

<center> 
<img src="../images/2020/09/covid-1984/FederalReserve.jpg" width="800"/> </center>
<center> </center>

Fed is printing a TON of money.

### Debt

Chris Edwards, the director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute, estimated that the the coronavirus pandemic will add $6 trillion to the $26.5 trillion national debt. Edwards warned that "Interest rates may spike, which will increase federal borrowing costs as accumulated debt is rolled over," which will result in "lasting economic damage." He estimated that tax revenue will fall 18 percent in 2020 and the economy will only be able to begin to recover closer to 2025.

For comparison,
WW1: $359B
WW2: $4.4T

and I've seen numbers that show we've already spent more on COVID than on both COMBINED.

### Goldman

In a recent note to clients, Goldman Sachs warned that current Federal Reserve monetary policy was causing “debasement fears" that could lead to a persistently weak dollar.

### BTC and Gold

March 15:
BTC - 5392
Gold - 1511
Silver - 13

Aug 5:
BTC - 11665: Up 116%
Gold - 1950: Up 29%
Silver - 26.9: Up 107%

I publicly advised my friends to buy gold, silver, and Bitcoin on June 7 and each of these is up 20-30% since then.

Why?

### Reserve Currencies

An analysis by JP Morgan found that the average lifespan of a reserve currency is about 100 years, ranging from 80-110.

So, if we follow this estimate, when is the dollar due to end its reign?

We would need to establish exactly when the dollar became the world's reserve currency, but this arguably began with the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement, which established fixed exchange rates between foreign currencies and the dollar, which at the time was backed by gold.

Thus, 1944 + 80-110 gives us as estimated "death date" of the dollar between approximately 2025-2050.


Stephen Roach, a senior fellow at Yale University and the former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, predicts that
the Dollar will plunge 35% and lose status as world reserve currency.

According to the Bank for International Settlements, the dollar’s share of official foreign-exchange reserves has declined from a little over 70% in 2000 to a little less than 60% today.

# Food Shortage

So, we've got violence on the streets and economic mayhem.

But it turns out that our food supply is also under attack.

"We're mobilizing our military and other forces but we're mobilizing our military on the basis that we do have a vaccine. You know, it's a massive job to give this vaccine."

"Our military is now being mobilized so at the end of the year we're going to be able to give it to a lot of people very, very rapidly," the president said.

101:10 - 101:20: approx 40

1 Hour of marchers, 2/s = 
60 * 60 * 2 = 72,000
83 minutes of marchers = 199,200


Oh, and by the way, do you think the world governments are going to help us?

A friend of mine attended a [protest against governmental COVID response][2] in Berlin on August XXX.
Organizers hoped to have 500K attend. Many were concerned that it was too ambitious.
How many showed up?

Bus tickets were sold out.
The streets were packed.

The organizer reported, "The police are telling us that we now have 800K in attendance."
"The police are telling us that we now have 1.3M in attendance."
This is in a country of 83 million people.

My friend reports that it was lovely, peaceful, like a picnic. Witnessed a mother breastfeeding an infant.

However, after the first speaker, the host announced: "The police are telling us that we are being shut down, two hours early."

What number did the media report? 17,000. And described the demonstrators as far-right, violent, neo-nazis.

According to my friend, the 2014 World Cup rally and the 2010 Love Parade were generally considered the two largest gatherings in Berlin history. This event, the Tag der Freiheit, is said to large as these two, perhaps larger.

# Conclusion

Folks, the media and the government are not going to save us. 

## Apocalypse Now

A popular neo-Nazi Telegram channel recently warned about the fallout of COVID-19 and a collapsing society. "There are going to be massive breakdowns in supply chains. There are going to be massive food shortages and brutal famines. There is going to be a mass die off. Millions, possibly billions will die."

This may not come to pass, but I have seen enough to believe that these are credible dangers.

## Freedom vs Tyranny

[Global fight for freedom][40]
"It's Freedom vs Tyranny and Tyranny is winning"
Bigger than WW2

I personally had no interest in politics or world affairs before the COVID lockdowns began.

However, I read 1984 in my teens, and in the back of my mind, I've always remembered to keep an eye out for complete totalitarianism.

And so, when the blatant censorship, nonsensical public health response, and ruthless oppression of the economy arrived, I kicked into high gear and have thus spent the past three and a half months learning about what we are up against.

Make no mistake, we are on the edge of the cliff.

## Hope

Rather that continue to remain in silence, I am writing this article in order to

in order to light a fire under you all.

I hope that my words have helped you to understand the gravity of the situation we are in.

That said, I hope that, even when staring into the abyss, none of you feel helpless.

## American Revolution

The founding fathers were paying a 3% tax on tea and were not being constantly spied on. 
Perhaps the media they consumed was as manipulative as it is today.

## What will the future look like?
