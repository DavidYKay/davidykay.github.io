title: Living a Principled Life
---

# Intro

In the past, I've paid lip service to living on principle, but the truth is that I haven't had the strength or courage to do so.

I've let my own fear get in the way.

I've been afraid that people would reject me if they knew the real truth about who I was and what I've done.

This has shown up for me in client management, romantic relationships, procrastination, and many more areas of my life.

## Avoiding Pain

The challenge seems to be that human beings are incredibly good at avoiding pain. 
We'd much rather deal with a chronic, gnawing pain that a sudden, strong one.
The result is that many of us are dying a death by 1000 cuts.

## Leap of Faith

The commitment that I'm making is to bear the pain.
To take the "leap of faith"
This is the kind of thing that doesn't FEEL good right away. It feels incredibly scary.

# Spiritual Strength / Congruence

However, I've realized that there are certain people out there who eminate an incredible strength. These are the individuals that could "stare the rust off a truck."
What makes that core so strong?
I think it's the incredibly deep sense of self-acceptance.

"It's not ethics unless you're giving something up."

## Bible

In the west, many look to organized religion, such as Christianity, for moral and ethical guidance.

Chariots of Fire

## Socrates

"The unexamined life is not worth living" - Socrates

# Incongruence

For me, I've always aspired to be a good person, but I've let those little incongruencies in my behavior add up, and they are killing my psyche.

"How can you be a good person if you haven't repaid this debt?"
"How can you be a good person if you failed to apologize?"
"How can you be a good person if you broke up in a cowardly way?"

# Taking Action

While I can't go back to the past, I can take the time to mend the wounds that still remain.

I spent this weekend refunding the money for a product I never launched and, having done it, I can confidently say: I should have done so months ago. 
I'm already feeling better about myself and am preparing to go back and deliberately right the wrongs that are still bothering me.
I may have a ways to go yet, but this feels like the right path. The noble path.

Yesterday, I sat down with my client and cleared the air, telling him all the things I'd been keeping from him.

I confessed: I haven't been telling you these things because I was afraid to lose the contract.
I now accept the possibility of completely losing the contract because I am placing honesty above revenue.
To do so, I am taking the leap of faith that there will always be a job for an honest person.

# What's Next For Me

I'm dedicating some time each morning to puzzle about my principles. 

I'm hoping that these can serve as a guideline for my decision making.

I'm also dedicating a lot of thought as of late to ask the question: can computers help humans live their best lives?

Is there a way of having a computer hold you to account, so that you live life according to your own values?

# What's Next For You

While I won't tell you what the right principles are to follow, I strongly suggest that you take the time to write them down and stick to them.

Life is a chaotic, messy affair
