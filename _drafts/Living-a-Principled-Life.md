title: Living a Principled Life
---

In the past, I've paid lip service to living on principle, but the truth is that I haven't had the strength or courage to do so.

I've let my own fear get in the way.

I've been afraid that people would reject me if they knew the real truth

This has shown up for me in client management, romantic relationships, procrastination, and many more areas of my life.

The challenge seems to be that human beings are incredibly good at avoiding pain. 
We'd much rather deal with a chronic, gnawing pain that a sudden, strong one.
The result is that many of us are dying a death by 1000 cuts.

The commitment that I'm making is to bear the pain.
To take the "leap of faith"

# The Four Agreements

- Don't Take Anything Personally
- Don't Make Assumptions
- Always Do Your Best

# The Four-Way Test

1. Is it the truth?
2. Is it fair to all concerned?
3. Will it build goodwill and better friendships?
4. Will it be beneficial to all concerned?
