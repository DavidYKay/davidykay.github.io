title: Living a Principled Life
---

In the past, I've paid lip service to living on principle, but the truth is that I haven't had the strength or courage to do so.

I've let my own fear get in the way.

I've been afraid that people would reject me if they knew the real truth

This has shown up for me in client management, romantic relationships, procrastination, and many more areas of my life.

The challenge seems to be that human beings are incredibly good at avoiding pain. 
We'd much rather deal with a chronic, gnawing pain that a sudden, strong one.
The result is that many of us are dying a death by 1000 cuts.

The commitment that I'm making is to bear the pain.
To take the "leap of faith"
This is the kind of thing that doesn't FEEL good right away. It feels incredibly scary.

However, I've realized that there are certain people out there who eminate an incredible strength. These are the individuals that could "stare the rust off a truck."
What makes that core so strong?
I think it's the incredibly deep sense of self-acceptance.

For me, I've always aspired to be a good person, but I've let those little incongruencies in my behavior add up, and they are killing my psyche.

"How can you be a good person if you haven't repaid this debt?"
"How can you be a good person if you failed to apologize?"
"How can you be a good person if you broke up in a cowardly way?"

While I can't go back to the past, I can take the time to mend the wounds that still remain.

I spent this weekend refunding the money for a product I never launched and, having done it, I can confidently say: I should have done so months ago. 
I'm already feeling better about myself and am preparing to go back and deliberately right the wrongs that are still bothering me.
I may have a ways to go yet, but this feels like the right path. The noble path.

While I won't tell you what the right principles are to follow, I strongly suggest that you take the time to write them down and stick to them.

Life is a chaotic, messy affair

Luckily, there are some incredibly intelligent individuals who have spent a lot of time thinking about this kind of thing.

# The Four-Way Test

1. Is it the truth?
2. Is it fair to all concerned?
3. Will it build goodwill and better friendships?
4. Will it be beneficial to all concerned?
