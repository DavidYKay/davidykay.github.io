title: Liberalism vs Conservatism
---

Openness to experience -> liberalism

> "Open individuals have an affinity for liberal, progressive, left-wing political views, whereas closed individuals prefer conservative, traditional right wing views.”
> -McCrae (1996)

"Once you engage the psychology of teams, it shuts down open-minded thinking."

Moral psychology

### The mind is NOT a blank slate

Marcus 2004 - Nature provides a first draft

## Software Conservatism vs Liberalism 

## MBTI Sensing vs Intuition

What separates a Sensor from an Intuitive? The ability to suspend one's disbelief.

## Scarcity vs Abundance

## 5 Foundations of Morality

1. Harm / Care
2. Fairness / reciprocity
3. Ingroup / loyalty - Large groups, tribal psychology. Sports
4. Authority/respct - Voluntary deference
5. Purity / sanctity - Sexuality - right, Organic foods - left

Liberals care about 1 and 2. Conservatives care about ALL five. All disagreements are over 3,4,5.

Timeless truth: Order decays. Social entropy.

Cooperation decays without punishment!
You need SOME kind of punishment. Shame, gossip, etc is fine.
Religion is an adaptation to make groups cohere!!!

The world's greatest wonder: NOT the grand canyon. Rome, Tenochtitlan, the great wall.

They used all five notes of morality!!!

Liberals fight this: no regard for 3,4,5.

Liberalism: order must be sacrificed for progress/change
Conservatism: order is precious

Are cons and libs yin and yang?

Our minds are designed to unite us into teams, divide us against others, 

If you want to change other people, understand that we all think we are right.

Commit to the truth.
