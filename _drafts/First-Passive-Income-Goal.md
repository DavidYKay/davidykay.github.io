title: My First Passive Income Goal
---

Inspired by Steve Pavlina's post on [setting a passive income goal](http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2012/04/set-your-passive-income-goal/), I'm announcing my intent to create my first passive income stream.

My goal is to create a passive income stream that earns $1000 / month for at least 12 months, earning my first dollar by April 15, 2017.

Ambitious? Yes. 

It's certainly more reasonable to expect to make $10/month, but $10/month doesn't put the fire in my belly the way that $1000/month does.

Also, isn't it better to dream big, burn the ships, and let your own ingenuity figure out how to get there?

Please keep me accountable as I'm assigning myself the following disincentives for if I don't reach my goal:

* If no income earned before April 15, 2017: I'll raffle my Steam account to the readers of this blog.
* If < $12,000 cumulative earned over 12 months: 
* If no income before April 15, 2018: I'll volunteer
