To my peers in the tech indsutry,

I'd like to share my own experience and advice today about [Repetitive strain injury][3] (RSI), an epidemic in our field that doesn't get much airtime.

I'm sure you've heard of [carpal tunnel syndrome][4], which is a specific form of RSI.

The bad news: our line of work means we're at increased risk to injuring our "upper extremity" - hands, wrists, forearms. Some programmers can no longer use o the haters.


The good news: these injuries are treatable and preventable.

# Risk factors

* Emacs
* Improper technique

Jim Johnson has written a series of books on self-treatment for various conditions. I've used his books to treat a knee injury and a case of elbow. I haven't tried his [carpal tunnel book][1] just yet, but I plan to purchase it and the [reviews][2] are stellar.
