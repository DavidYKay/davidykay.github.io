How do you keep motivated at work?

When you're in school, you can see the end of the tunnel and be able to sprint towards the end of the semester. Feel free and feel accomplished. When you're working, there's no "end of the semester". It just keeps going, and it feels like a never-ending sprint. When you're working in a stressful job with a stressful environment, how do you keep going? Or do you jump ship to the next job once the job burns you out?

Personally, I feel like I've burnt out awhile ago, and I get spurts of rests but not enough of it. Even when I take off, I just feel anxiety over work I'm not doing. I took the day off today because I'm sick, but my anxiety over missing work hasn't let me rest properly. What can I do to keep going? Any tips or advice out there?

1. Take vacations. And let yourself relax when you're on one. It sounds like for you, allowing yourself to relax is a bigger challenge than actually taking the time off!

2. Take care of your body. Diet, sleep, and exercise will make a huge difference to how you feel day-to-day. Studies have shown that exercise is way more effective than anti-depressants for improving happiness.

3. Consider a meditation practice. There are many forms of meditation, but I recommend the approach documented in The Mind Illuminated if you need a starting place.

4. Consider your anxiety: what is causing it? What are you afraid of? Consider speaking with a therapist, hypnotist, or even your journal so that you can be as explicit as possible about what you're trying to avoid/prevent/run away from. The Untethered Soul is a helpful read on this topic.

5. Spend more time with the people you care about. We are inherently social creatures. We love spending time with people we love. One caution: we are the average of the five people we spend the most time with. So choose carefully. 

6. Spend some time considering your long-term goals. What do you want your life to look like? Is your present reality bringing you closer to this? Do you need to make some changes in order to move closer to your long-term goals? After reflection, is your your present reality ACTUALLY bringing you closer to your long-term goals, but the madness of each moment has been preventing you from seeing this?

I recommend reading 7 Habits of Highly Successful People, which describes a good approach for sitting down and getting really clear about what you want in life.

7. Now that you're clear on what you want, consider re-programming yourself using hypnosis and affirmations. Jim Newman's Release Your Brakes is a great starting point for this.

Good luck. We believe in you.
