title: Stressed Out? Try Acupuncture.
---

## Intro

A good friend of mine regularly undergoes acupuncture. She tells me that it's not only therapeutic but also relaxing to sit in a chair with needles sticking into her body.

Living in Vancouver, BC, when someone tells me she enjoys a needle in her arm, my mind doesn't immediately think of acupuncture... 

On a more serious note, the idea of adopting acupuncture as an regular, preventative therapy for healthy people hadn't occurred to me! Moreover, I hadn't considered that the experience itself could be pleasurable rather than painful.

## Childhood

My familiarity and experience with acupuncture is extremely limited.

Before recently, the only acupuncture experience I had was in childhood; my mother, avidly interested in the healing practices of the East, took my brother and I to get acupuncture treatment a few times. I believe she was hoping to cure my brother's allergies and brought me along as the unwitting control group.

The prospect of having a stranger jab me in the back with needles was unappealing, but, after the needles were in me, it was less painful and more meditative than anticipated. 

Unfortunately, I wasn't in tune with my body at that age, so I didn't reach a clear conclusion on how helpful or hurtful the treatment was.

I do, however, remember my brother falling asleep and snoring loudly, just minutes after the needles went in!

How bizarre that after a seemingly painful and damaging experience (poked by needles) that one should enter such a deep and relaxed slumber!

Which brings us to our main point...

## Rediscovering Acupuncture

### Parasympathetic Activation / Stress Reduction

I'm not yet sure whether acupuncture can be used as a precision tool (to heal specific organs, etc), but I am sure that it evokes a powerful parasympathetic nervous system response.

I went in for my first session since childhood recently and I wasn't expecting my body to react so strongly and suddenly. 

During the first session, I fell completely asleep within minutes. As one would expect from a nap, I awoke feeling recharged. What differentiated this from a normal nap was the incredible feeling of relaxation and well-being that had come over me.

The sensation was amazing. It felt as if my worldly concerns had melted away.

Not bad for a few needles and no drug use!

### Muscular Relaxation / Athletic Recovery

During the second session, I entered a meditative state and observed my body unconsciously relaxing. I first let out some gas I had been holding onto (sorry, neighbors!) as my stomach relaxed, and then felt the muscles of my body gradually loosen up and release metabolites. 
For me, this loosening and releasing process usually takes hours (often overnight), but the needles compressed the schedule to minutes! It was bizarre to watch my body rapidly move from tension to relaxation, prompted by perhaps ten needles in the extremities of my body.

### Why this matters

As a bit of a workaholic, I love the sensation of a cortisol high. Stress? Bring it ON! I find it a lot of fun to feel like I'm running on adrenaline. It reminds me that I'm alive! 

Unfortunately, researchers are finding that chronically elevated cortisol levels have many adverse health effects, from adrenal fatigue to brain damage!

Thus, if we want to take good care of our health for the long term, it's important to have activities in our lives that bring us down from the cortisol high. 

### Compared to other ways of activating the parasympathetic nervous system

Acupuncture is surprisingly potent. For me, it outperforms floating. It seems to be similar to CBD oil, but I'm not very experienced with cannabis products, so the jury is still out on this one. So far, I'm leaning more towards acupuncture because the chemicals involved are all produced by one's own body, rather than introduced from an external source. I may conduct further experiments to see if CBD can offer such a rapid response, but I'm a bit concerned about acclimation.
