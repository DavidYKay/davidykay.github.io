title: Stressed Out? Try Acupuncture.
---

# Intro

A good friend of mine volunteers at an acupuncture clinic and regularly undergoes acupuncture. She tells me that it's both relaxing and therapeutic to sit in a chair with a handful of needles sticking into the body.

A. The idea of adopting acupuncture as an effective, weekly therapy hadn't even occurred to me!
B. That it could be pleasurable rather than painful seemed equally alien.

# Childhood

Some background: my familiarity and experience with acupuncture is extremely limited.

Before recently, the only acupuncture experience I had was in childhood; my mother, avidly interested in the healing practices of the East, took my brother and I to get acupuncture treatment a few times. If memory serves, it was one of the outlets my mother explored in other to treat my brother's allergies.  

The prospect of having a stranger jab me in the back with needles was unappealing to say the least, but, after the needles were in me, it was much less painful and more meditative than I had anticipated. 

Unfortunately, I wasn't in tune with my body at that age, so I didn't reach a clear conclusion on how helpful or hurtful acupuncture could be.

I do, however, remember my brother falling fast asleep and snoring loudly, just minutes after the needles went in!

How bizarre, that after what is ostensibly a painful and damaging experience (needles poked in the skin) that one should enter such a deep and relaxed slumber!

Which brings us to our main point...

# Main Point

## First Experience - Parasympathetic / Stress

I'm not yet sure whether acupuncture can be used as a precision tool (to heal specific organs, etc), but I am sure that it evokes a powerful parasympathetic nervous system response.

I went in for my first session since childhood recently and I wasn't expecting my body to react so strongly and suddenly. 

During the first session, I fell completely asleep within minutes. As one would expect from a nap, I awoke feeling recharged. What differentiated this from a normal nap was the incredible feeling of relaxation and well-being that had come over me.

The sensation was amazing. Like my worldly concerns had melted away.

Not bad for a few needles and no drug use!

## Second Experience - Muscular

During the second session, I entered a meditative state and observed my body unconsciously relaxing. I first let out some gas I had been holding onto (sorry, neighbors!) as my stomach relaxed, and then felt the muscles of my body gradually loosen up and release metabolites. For me, this loosening and releasing process usually takes hours (often overnight), but I was witnessing it happen within minutes!

## Why this matters

As a bit of a workaholic, I've realized that it's important to have activities in my life that help bring me down from the cortisol high. Yes, I find it a lot of fun to feel like I'm running on adrenaline. It reminds me that I'm alive! 

But, we're finding that chronically elevated cortisol levels have many adverse health effects, from adrenal fatigue to brain damage!

## Compared to other ways of activating the parasympathetic nervous system

Acupuncture is surprisingly potent. For me, it outperforms floating. It seems to be similar to CBD oil, but I'm not very experienced with cannabis products, so the jury is still out on this one. So far, I'm leaning more towards acupuncture because the chemicals involved are all produced by one's own body, rather than introduced from an external source. I may conduct further experiments to see if CBD can offer such a rapid response, but I'm a bit concerned about acclimation.
