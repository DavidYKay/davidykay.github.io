Before the COVID-19 lockdowns, I spent very little of my time and attention on politics and world affairs, thinking of it as an icky thing that other people can worry themselves with.

However, the loss of freedom, contradictory stories, and sharp [rise in censorship][52] quickly captured my attention, causing me to ask, "What's really going on here?"

And so, I've spent a great deal of time over the past several months trying to understand how the world came to be in its current state, where it's going, and what action that we, as a civilization, should undertake in order to keep humanity on a sane path.

I make no claims to be a great philosopher or leader of men. However, I swear that I have come to the following conclusions after much research and deliberation, and will provide several references so that you can perform your own analysis.  

## The Sugar Lie

Before I proceed, I'd like to tell you a story about disinformation.

You may have witnessed dietary advice recently shift from "fat is bad" to "sugar is bad."

How did we get it so wrong last time?

It turns out that the sugar industry [paid off][50] two researchers, using "approximately **$50,000** in today's dollars."

Can you imagine the **decades of harm** that $50,000 dollars caused? The millions of people affected by health issues from following *deliberately* sabotaged health guidelines?

What's worse, a [2016 study published in JAMA][51] finds that we aren't yet free of corrupt scientific inquiry, asking, "Is it really true that food companies deliberately set out to manipulate research in their favor? Yes, it is, and the practice continues."

The study concludes, "Policymaking committees should consider giving less weight to food industry-funded studies." 

More importantly, I suspect that this danger is not unique to the food industry.

# The Media

## Conformity

We often hear that humans are "herd animals." That we are the "average of the five people we spend the most time with."

Most of us have an instinct to fit in, and this has been [well-studied and exploited][53].

One of the most dangerous effects of this instinct is when we [DISREGARD our own judgment][54] due to [group pressure][55]. 

I've caved to groupthink several times, myself. And I'm not proud of it.

## 9/11 & GWOT

Remember 9/11? 

I do. I was 13 at the time. I remember watching the towers fall perfectly symmetrically after planes had hit each one, leaving highly asymmetrical damage near the very top of the building.

I remember asking myself, "WTF? How could a total, symmetrical collapse occur after a small amount of damage was sustained at the top of the building?"

But I looked around at my friends and family and they told me, "They would never lie to us!" 

So, I pushed through my cognitive dissonance and went with the group. These were really smart people! My friends and family couldn't ALL be wrong...

And so, I attended the patriotic memorial services and was in awe of the "Together we stand" messages that were posted everywhere.

Congress passed the Patriot Act. It seemed to me like a big over-reaction. Like these heart-broken senators and congressmen were overwhelmed with grief for their fallen countrymen and felt that, in such a situation, it was OK to **temporarily** grant over-reaching surveillance powers to law enforcement.

## Spending

Looks like the joke was on us.

Here we are, nearly 20 years later, and we never found any WMDs in Iraq, 801,000 are dead, and we've [spent $6.4 trillion][38], no end in sight.

Not only is the "temporary" Patriot Act still in effect, we've grossly [expanded federal law enforcement][57], founded a [combat command dedicated to North America][56], and [killed habeus corpus][37].


## Critics

When I look back, were there people who smelled a rat at the time?

There were.

Around the world, many [large demonstrations][59] were held around the world, protesting the Iraq War as an [oil grab][58].

These demonstrations, even those held in the United States, were dismissed as the actions of a ["vocal minority"][60].

Indeed, it was not politically wise to speak out against the war in the early days.

You may remember that many critics were shut down for speaking out against the narrative presented by the Bush administration and the media. That these people were labeled "unpatriotic, heartless, and unsympathetic" to the families who had lost their loved ones in this terrifying, hateful act.

Some critical journalists were even [placed on the No Fly List][62].

You may also remember the wave of xenophobic violence that broke out. Many [hate crimes][63] were perpetrated in the weeks following 9/11.

Most interestingly, there was an incredible amount of contradictory information and redacted testimony.

"It looked like a controlled demolition." "Just kidding, it wasn't."
"Flight 11 is still in the air!" "No, flight 11 crashed."
"WTC-7 has collapsed already!" "No, it didn't collapsed until 10 minutes later"
"I heard explosions" "I definitely didn't hear explosions"


Does any of this sound familiar?

## Truth

Did you know that thousands of [military officials][30], [pilots][28], and [architects][29] have voiced public criticism of the official explanation?

Those of an engineering background may enjoy this [study][33] from the University of Alaska Fairbanks, which refutes the official WTC7 engineering study.

Did you know that an [Israeli observation team][36] was set up in New Jersey around 8AM, approximately 45 minutes before the impact for the first tower?

## Censorship

## Media Mentions vs Deaths

## Operation Mockingbird

# Nonsensical Health Guidelines

## False Quarantine

Over the last 11 weeks, most of us have been kept in our homes and away from our jobs.

Our governor, Jay Inslee, announced to us on March 24, “This is a human tragedy on a scale we cannot yet project. It’s time to hunker down in order to win this fight,” Inslee said during a televised address."

What he failed to mention is that that "scale we cannot yet project" might be have been much smaller than we thought.

**Do you believe COVID-19 death counts are factual: 0%**

### Quarantining healthy people

**First time quarantining healthy people**

Also, did you know that 90% of the 165 doctors interviewed on a recent London Real episode believe that:

* **Social distancing has no scientific basis whatsoever: 90%**, 
* **"Wearing of a mask is contributing to the suppression the immune system: 95%"**

#### Military Vaccination

President Trump announced two weeks ago that 

"We're mobilizing our military and other forces but we're mobilizing our military on the basis that we do have a vaccine. You know, it's a massive job to give this vaccine."

"Our military is now being mobilized so at the end of the year we're going to be able to give it to a lot of people very, very rapidly," the president said.

# Corruption of Healthcare Industry

Until recently, I didn't know much about the vaccine industry, but the recent insistence that we ALL stay in our homes and don't develop natural immunity to the virus and wait around until we are innoculated with a vaccine made me very curious.

## 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act

1980s vaccine industry comes to congress, asks for bailout.
They were getting HAMMERED by lawsuits!!!
"We can't afford to be in business"
Congress bailed them out.

Government then took up the responsibility for vaccination. Promised to perform safety studies every 2 years.

According to Dr. Rashid Buttar, "Number of safety studies conducted: 0"

No liability. Guaranteed income.
**Defendant is now: HHS!!!**
**DOJ defends HHS!!!**

Fighting our own government because we've been injured by something that THEY'VE mandated.
NO LIABILITY.

1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act
[wikipedia][6]

"... so the industry got together and manufacturers said, holy cow, now we have a product that has no liability, and that’s the biggest cost for drugs.
o they said, number one, we don’t have to test it, that’s a huge cost avoided.  Number two, there’s no liability and that’s the biggest cost avoided.  Number three, there’s no marketing or advertising costs, because it’s mandated.  So it’s just like printing money."

" you can get a vaccine on the CDC’s recommended schedule it averages about a billion dollars annually in pure profits for your company .  When I was a kid I got three vaccines and was fully compliant and today’s kids get 72 vaccines."

- Bobby Kennedy, Jr.

## PREP Act

declared public health emergency:

"immunity from liability (except for willful misconduct) for claims of loss caused, arising out of, relating to, or resulting from administration or use of
countermeasures to diseases, threats and conditions determined 

"entities and individuals involved in the development, manufacture, testing, distribution, administration, and use of such countermeasures."

## Gates

Interestingly, Bill Gates has recently been calling for indemnification from the governments of the world.

Since he's been funding vaccinations around the globe for some time now, and Business Insider writes that he is funding [seven different factories][87] for the manufacture of a COVID-19 vaccine.

So, I thought I'd look into some of the track record of his organizations.

### Africa: DTP

Diphtheria, Tetanus, and pertussis

Bobby Kennedy: 
"no longer being used in USA. Still used in Africa.

In a 2017 study funded by the Danish International Development Agency and the Novo Nordisk foundation found that infants given the DTP (Diptheria-Tetanus-Pertussis) vaccine experienced a [5x mortality rate][11] versus un-vaccinated children.

This vaccine was [dropped by western nations in in 1990s][75], "following thousands of reports of death and brain damage,"

but, according to their 2018 Annual report, GAVI (a Gates-backed "global alliance for vaccines and immunization") was still administering three doses of DTP vaccine to African youth, claiming a coverage of 64 million african children. [76]

### India: 490K Paralysis

paralysis between 2000 and 2017 - oral polio vaccine (OPV)

A study published in the International journal of Environmental Research and Public Health found that:

The correlation between trailing 5-years vaccine doses with the incidence of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis was extremely strong with an R-value of (0.76) p value < 0.001.

Their research strongly suggests that 490,000 vaccinated Indian youth developed paralysis as a result of polio vaccination. 

They conclude, very diplomatically, "that this finding will help continue efforts at optimizng the dose schedule of [polio vaccine] administration  and result in a reduction in [paralysis]."

[Indian paralysis][19] 

2017 - [Indian govt reduces Gates Foundation immunization funding] [18]

Why reduce funding if it's working?

## Kenya

"We are not convinced that the government has taken adequate responsibility to ensure that Tetanus Toxoid vaccine (TT) laced with Beta human chorionic gonadotropin (b-HCG) sub unit is not being used by the sponsoring development partners. This has previously been used by the same partners in Philippines, Nicaragua and Mexico to vaccinate women against future pregnancy. Beta HCG sub unit is a hormone necessary for pregnancy." 

"When injected as a vaccine to a non-pregnant woman, this Beta HCG sub unit combined with tetanus toxoid develops antibodies against tetanus and HCG so that if a woman’s egg becomes fertilized, her own natural HCG will be destroyed rendering her permanently infertile. In this situation tetanus vaccination has been used as a birth control method." - [Kenya][14]


> Is there a tetanus crisis in Kenya? If this is so, why has it not been declared?
> Why does the campaign target women of 14 – 49years?
> Why has the campaign left out young girls, boys and men even if they are all prone to tetanus?
> In the midst of so many life threatening diseases in Kenya, why has tetanus been prioritized?

2:

> We sent six samples from around Kenya to laboratories in South Africa. They tested positive for the HCG antigen. They were all laced with HCG.
> 
> This proved right our worst fears; that this WHO campaign is not about eradicating neonatal tetanus but a well-coordinated forceful population control mass sterilization exercise using a proven fertility regulating vaccine. This evidence was presented to the Ministry of Health before the third round of immunization but was ignored.

3:

> Either we are lying or the government is lying. But ask yourself, ‘What reason do the Catholic doctors have for lying?’ The Catholic Church has been here in Kenya providing health care and vaccinating for 100 years for longer than Kenya has existed as a country.
> 
> Usually we give a series three shots over two to three years, we give it anyone who comes into the clinic with an open wound, men, women or children. If this is intended to inoculate children in the womb, why give it to girls starting at 15 years? You cannot get married till you are 18.
> -- Dr. Muhame Ngare of the Mercy Medical Centre in Nairobi


 "even before FP2020, Depo-Provera was already the most widely used contraceptive in many sub-Saharan African countries. Nevertheless, studies had indicated that there were risks. DMPA, the active ingredient in Depo, had been linked with loss of bone density, significant menstrual irregularities, and an increased risk of breast cancer. More troubling, especially for countries with high HIV rates, was some early evidence that DMPA may increase a user's risk of acquiring HIV."
 - [PSMag][27]

### RNA Vaccine

According to Dr. Rashid Buttar, this vaccine: 
1. Never tested in animals
2. First vaccine by this co
3. First human-consumable by Moderna
4. Direct-to-human testing

**Does 5G have an immuno-suppressive component: 95%**
**Conflict of interest w/ Dr. Fauci advising the govt: 97%**
**Number of supporters of COVID vaccine in next 12 months: 0/150**


# Escalating violence

## Chicago

Chicago Sun-Times: year-on-year homicides up 139% 

## NYC

July: 177% increase in shootings

## Bellingham

Bellingham burglaries up 90% for April-June YOY.

## Election Violence

Rasmussen poll: 62% of voters believe it is at least "somewhat likely" the Far Left will commit acts of violence if Trump is reelected.

[just over 20 percent of both Democratic and Republican respondents believe][15] violence is at least somewhat justified if their side loses the election.


# Monetary Problems

## Job Counts

**Fresh unemployment claims increased to 1.43 million last week — the 19th consecutive week in which claims exceeded one million — crushing all existing records.**

Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, the previous record for weekly unemployment filings was 695,000 in 1982. 

2008 crisis had filings in the five-and-six-hundred thousands, totalling 37M claims. Good thing we haven't hit that, right?

Oh wait:

**More than 55 million Americans have sought jobless benefits since state shutdowns began in mid-March.**

A May 19 article in Forbes reports that:

April unemployment report posted rate of 14.7%, up from 4.4%
It is estimated that unemployment hit 24.9% during the Great Depression.
Including marginally attached job seekers [pushes the rate to 27.6%][10] 

* is currently not in the labor force
* wants full-time work
* has actively looked for a job sometime in the past 12 months
* Not currently actively looking

## Consumer Confidence

Understandably, the U.S. consumer confidence index dropped to 92.6 in July, down from 98.3 in June. This reading lower than the estimated 94.5 for July. 

"consumers have grown less optimistic about the short-term outlook for the economy and labor market and remain subdued about their financial prospects."  

## GDP

Numbers I've seen for GDP decline during the Great Depression vary from approximately 30% to 45%, over a 4-year period, from 1929 to 1933.

How are we doing so far, now that we are about five months into what seems to be the greatest depression since the Great Depression?

Well, the numbers from Q2 are in, finding that

[for April-June, the US economy has contracted at 33% annual rate, the worst economic drop on record][12]

Personal consumption — down 34.6%, annualized
Services — travel, tourism, restaurants, etc. — down 43.5%
Business investment — down 37.7%
New housing — down 38.7%
Exports — down 64%
Federal government spending — from a reduced tax base — up 17%.

In a quarter of record GDP contraction... and record unemployment… disposable personal income skyshot 42.1%, again annualized.

Joel Naroff, of Naroff Economic Advisers:
“The only way you have personal income rising in a collapsing economy is if you turn to a massive welfare economy.”

## Covid Relief

Speaking of welfare economy, thank heavens for the CARES act! Imagine how bleak things would be without that additional federal aid.

I hate to break it to you, but the [CARES act benefits are drying up.][13]

* Unemployment benefits are set to fall 65% for the average person after July 31, when the $600-a-week boost expires. 
* Some will see a much sharper drop. In Oklahoma, there would be a 93% drop to $44 a week, according to most recent Labor Department data. 

## Inflation Concerns

Fed is printing a TON of money.

### Debt

Chris Edwards, the director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute, estimated that the the coronavirus pandemic will add $6 trillion to the $26.5 trillion national debt. Edwards warned that "Interest rates may spike, which will increase federal borrowing costs as accumulated debt is rolled over," which will result in "lasting economic damage." He estimated that tax revenue will fall 18 percent in 2020 and the economy will only be able to begin to recover closer to 2025.

For comparison,
WW1: $359B
WW2: $4.4T

and I've seen numbers that show we've already spent more on COVID than on both COMBINED.

### Goldman

In a recent note to clients, Goldman Sachs warned that current Federal Reserve monetary policy was causing “debasement fears" that could lead to a persistently weak dollar.

### BTC and Gold

March 15:
BTC - 5392
Gold - 1511
Silver - 13

Aug 5:
BTC - 11665: Up 116%
Gold - 1950: Up 29%
Silver - 26.9: Up 107%

I publicly advised my friends to buy gold, silver, and Bitcoin on June 7 and each of these is up 20-30% since then.

Why?

### Reserve Currencies

An analysis by JP Morgan found that the average lifespan of a reserve currency is about 100 years, ranging from 80-110.

So, if we follow this estimate, when is the dollar due to end its reign?

We would need to establish exactly when the dollar became the world's reserve currency, but this arguably began with the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement, which established fixed exchange rates between foreign currencies and the dollar, which at the time was backed by gold.

Thus, 1944 + 80-110 gives us as estimated "death date" of the dollar between approximately 2025-2050.


Stephen Roach, a senior fellow at Yale University and the former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, predicts that
the Dollar will plunge 35% and lose status as world reserve currency.

According to the Bank for International Settlements, the dollar’s share of official foreign-exchange reserves has declined from a little over 70% in 2000 to a little less than 60% today.

### Indemnification

## 1970s Swine Flu immunization

hopes to immunize "every man, woman, and child."

The first was later in 1976, when instead of boxes of bottled vaccine, the vaccine manufacturers delivered an ultimatum—that the federal government indemnify them against claims of adverse reactions as a requirement for release of the vaccines. The government quickly capitulated to industry's demand for indemnification.

"NIIP administered a program that immunized 45 million in 10 weeks, which resulted in doubling the level of immunization for persons deemed to be at high risk, rapidly identifying adverse effects, and developing and administering an informed consent form for use in a community-based program."

## Gates on COVID vaccine

## Berlin COVID

Oh, and by the way, do you think the world governments are going to help us?

A friend of mine attended a [protest against governmental COVID response][2] in Berlin on August XXX.
Organizers hoped to have 500K attend. Many were concerned that it was too ambitious.
How many showed up?

Bus tickets were sold out.
The streets were packed.
If you look at historic gatherings and marches in Berlin, such as the 2014 World Cup rally or the Love Parade, this event was as large as the biggest ones there, perhaps larger.

The organizer reported, "The police are telling us that we now have 800K in attendance."
"The police are telling us that we now have 1.3M in attendance."
This is in a country of 83 million people.

My friend reports that it was lovely, peaceful, like a picnic. Witnessed a mother breastfeeding an infant.

However, after the first speaker, the host announced: "The police are telling us that we are being shut down, two hours early."

What number did the media report? 17,000. And described the demonstrators as far-right, violent, neo-nazis.

# Conclusion

Folks, the media and the government are not going to save us. 

A popular neo-Nazi Telegram channel recently warned about the fallout of COVID-19 and a collapsing society. "There are going to be massive breakdowns in supply chains. There are going to be massive food shortages and brutal famines. There is going to be a mass die off. Millions, possibly billions will die."

This may not come to pass, but I have seen enough to believe that these are credible dangers.

I was asked to prepare this presentation today in order to light a fire under you all.

I hope that my words have helped you to understand the gravity of the situation we are in.

That said, I hope that, even when staring into the abyss, none of you feel helpless.

If you feel discouraged, I ask you to remember that we are fortunate to be living in the greatest country on the planet. 

Fallen from grace as it may be, we still have our freedom, and we have each other.

We have the choice for how we meet our fate, and, as they say, it is always darkest before the dawn.

I personally had no interest in politics or world affairs before the COVID lockdowns began.

However, I read 1984 in my teens, and in the back of my mind, I've always remembered to keep an eye out for complete totalitarianism.

And so, when the blatant censorship, nonsensical public health response, and ruthless oppression of the economy arrived, I kicked into high gear and have thus spent the past three and a half months learning about what we are up against.

Make no mistake, we are on the edge of the cliff.
