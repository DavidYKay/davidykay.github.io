# Thesis

## Stupid Lockdowns

Larken Rose has an [excellent video][1] detailing why the COVID-19 lockdowns are "stupid, pointless, and evil." I highly recommend that you watch it.

A summary of his argument goes like this:

* Experts recommended that we "flatten the curve" to prevent an overwhelm of the healthcare system and its ability to respond to the crisis.
* At NO POINT did they claim that social distancing, mask wearing, hand washing, staying at home, etc. would PREVENT us from getting the disease. Instead, these were meant as means of slowing down the spread.
* The vast majority of all healthcare facilities are no longer overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients, so if we continue to "flatten the curve," we are merely PROLONGING the effect of COVID-19 on our lives and our economy. With no benefit.
* The economic damage from the shutdowns is colossal.

So colossal, by the way, that it has lead to the [greatest decline of American GDP on record][12].

Without going into the reliability of the testing procedure, we have to ask ourselves: what's really going on here?

A nugget of wisdom I received from Dr. Jordan B. Peterson says this: if an individual repeatedly takes an action and gets the same result, then perhaps the result that he's getting is actually what he wants.

Today, I'd like to make the argument that perhaps this tremendous economic damage is actually what our government wants.

# Fiat Currency

## Gold Standard

create money out of nothing

# 2009 - Beginning of QE

Fed: "we will continue to print money until the problem is resolved"

$3.3T Bailout
25% of GNP GONE
in two months

1 Trillion dollars / day

## 2011 - Some documents released

Paul asks for full audit

## Moral Hazard

## Restaurants

# Quantitative Easing

[QE: How it destroys a society][5]

## In theory
artificial supply of treasury bonds
increases price, lowers yield
incentivizes pensions to invest into stock market, corp bonds

## In Practice

Fed Put -> signals they will backstop the market with printed money

[Moral hazard][6] -> "Moral hazard is the idea that a party protected in some way from risk will act differently than if they didn't have that protection."

Consumption lending & mortgages, inflating asset prices

MBS -> sold back to Wall St. Often resold to repo market.
Stock market - completely detached from real economy

Financial economy: should have a relationship with real economy:

## Fed can't stop QE

Dog wags tail:

Real economy that contributes to financial economy
allaws economy to expand

Tail wags dog:
Financial economy consumes real economy
Real economy now driven by asset prices. Ass-backward.

Direct correlation between fed balance sheet and the S&P 500.

Financial ecomony much larger than the real economy.

Banks now incentivized to take more risk

privatize the profits, socialize the losses


# Fed Sabotaging the Economy

George gammon [video][3]

## How much printing
## How fast

250 billion in 7 weeks in Q4 2019
QE4: 35B/week
QE3: 40B/month
QE2: 75B/month

## How long

Haven't stopped since...

## Will they ever stop printing?

Original target: 2%
"Average" of 2% inflation

2009: "QE is a permanent tool"

When they raise rates / stop QE, they stop printing.

"They know they don't have a choice"

NO! Printing forever

## Endgame

Once you let the inflation genie out of the bottle, it's game over.

Long end of yield curve (10-year, 30-year) goes way up
Crushes asset prices, debt, confidence, imploding the economy.

Fed will break out,
Print more money to buy bonds -> More inflation -> Raise Rates -> Destroy Economy -> Print...

Wildcard: MMT

Economy based on:
* Assets 
* Debt 
* confidence


## Fed Trying ot Keep the lid on

QE4: "This is not QE"

What Is Quantitative Easing (QE)?

Quantitative easing (QE) is a form of unconventional monetary policy in which a central bank purchases longer-term securities from the open market in order to increase the money supply and encourage lending and investment. Buying these securities adds new money to the economy, and also serves to lower interest rates by bidding up fixed-income securities. It also expands the central bank's balance sheet.

When short-term interest rates are either at or approaching zero, the normal open market operations of a central bank, which target interest rates, are no longer effective. Instead, a central bank can target specified amounts of assets to purchase. Quantitative easing increases the money supply by purchasing assets with newly-created bank reserves in order to provide banks with more liquidity.

## 2020 QE

According to FitchRatings, quantitative easing asset purchases are likely to hit a total of $6 trillion in 2020.
In the United States, the pre-pandemic balance sheet was recently about $4.3 trillion. That figure was up to $6.5 trillion by April 23. 
As of April 21, the U.S. Federal Reserve was buying about $41 billion in assets daily; 

# Top Fears: Corrupt Government

"For the fourth year in a row the top fear of Americans is corrupt government officials. And as in the previous four years, the fear that our government is corrupt far exceeds all others we asked about."

Are you being affected by the lockdowns?

I have the good fortune that I'm still able to work in the current situation, but there are many who cannot.

Some are being swept up by the riots in the streets,
