Here are the books I recommend from the "Bootstrapper's Bookshelf:" 

The Toilet Paper Entrepreneur by Mike Michalowicz - How do you start a business with NO resources available? How do you build a business that is a good match for your personality? Mike Michalowicz's writing style is incredibly humorous, to-the-point, and actionable. If you enjoy this one, he has a whole series of books on entrepreneurship which I highly recommend. 
The Obstacle is the Way by Ryan Holiday - An incredible book on the fundamentals of stoic philosophy and its ability to "turn trials into triumph."
The Greatest Salesman in the World by Og Mandino - Sometimes, a little bit of brainwashing goes a long way. The idea behind this book is that we are all able to reprogram our own thinking by continually giving ourselves suggestions that will open up our minds to better possibilities and behaviors. It comes with ten essays that you read over and over to internalize and make part of your thinking. Hokey? Maybe. But maybe not.
Born Standing Up by Steve Martin - In his memoir, Steve Martin shows us his long, challenging, often ambiguous journey to becoming a world-renowned comedian.
