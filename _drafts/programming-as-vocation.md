## Setting the scene

Our nation (if not our world) is in a time of great uncertainty at the moment.

I've spent a lot of my cycles in 2020 focused on the great upset in the air.

A friend of mine advised me early in the crisis to focus on not winning this game but the next one.

So be it. I am now putting my energies at the future that we can all build together, rather than reacting to the situations that I find myself in on the ground.

We are heading into one of the greatest if not greatest depressions in American history.

### GDP loss

International agencies estimate the contraction in GNP worldwide at -5.2%. The Eurozone with be the hardest hit with -9.1%. “It is the worst economic recession since 1870, a devastating blow for the world economy,” declared David Malpass, president of World Bank Group.

“It is the worst crisis since the Second World War, capable of bringing devastation to the health, the well-being and the work of people, creating unprecedented uncertainty,” said OCSE analyst Robert Boone.

### Currency Collapse

"real concerns around the longevity of the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency."
- [Goldman Sachs][2]

“But we’re in a spot in which we’re also going to have to think about what the value of the money is, what the value of the dollars are, what the value of bonds are… And history suggests that we’re at an inflection point in which the value of money is an important consideration,”
- [Ray Dalio][3]

“We’re about to see that this is going to be a complete disaster, because the dollar is going to collapse,” 
-[Peter Schiff][6]

“The Fed dug a hole and they can’t get out of it,”
-[Jim Rickards][6]

### Don't need a degree

Many successful individuals, including superstars such as John Carmack, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, and Mark Zuckerberg, have found their success without a degree.

### Teaching others

I've taught three individuals to program.

Two of them are now working full-time in the technology industry and the third was for a period of time making a full-time living from a service built atop software he had written.

### Online Resources

These days, there are many online resources to learn to program. 

[Codecademy][10] is a popular one. When I tried it, I personally found that it held my hand too much and didn't force me to think, reducing its effectiveness as a learning tool. It may have been improved since I've last used it.

Early in my programming career, I gained a lot of value from a Python course at Udacity. From what I can tell, the one I took is no longer offered, but there is a [successor][11] available.

If you want something even more realistic and hands-on, I recommend [Learn Python the Hard Way][12].

I personally benefitted greatly from learning the basics in a classroom environment. Programming can be very intimidating at first, but there's something in the human psyche that makes suffering as a group less painful than doing so one one's own. If you have an opportunity to take a class nearby, perhaps at your local community college, or with a study group, I highly recommend that. The COVID-19 response in your area may preclude you from participating face-to-face, but I trust in your ingenuity to find a solution that works for you.

## Final CTA

### A programming game

We at Freeside are developing a programming game to help people discover the joy of computer programming.

"preparing programs for a digital computer is especially attractive, not only because it can be economically and scientifically rewarding, but also because it can be an aesthetic experience much like composing poetry or painting."
- Donald E. Knuth 

We'll be launching soon.
