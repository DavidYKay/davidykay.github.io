title: The Dawn of Virtual Reality

Began: 1924
End: 

Friends,

We are sitting at a very important time in history.

While I am a firm believer that our future is to merge with technological intelligence, the exciting vista before us is that of virtual reality.

Computing began as an esoteric pursuit, the domain of priests and neckbeards, but has increasingly become a part of the life of the average person.

Even people living in rural Africa with no electricity in their homes now use smartphones on a daily basis.

Development experts around the world have been forecasting that the entire world will be developed by 2050

Many are concerned that the future of automation around the world will cause a mass loss of jobs, leaving the average person as a penniless beggar.

Sam Altman of Y-combinator has predicted that the future will center around basic income for the average person, with Virtual Reality to keep them entertained.
Not a far cry from Nero's "bread and circuses."

However, this fate of a two-class system is not definite.

Naval Ravikant likes to point out that automation is not happening for the first time, it's been happening for hundreds of years! During the Industrial Revolution, many of the same cries went out, as people complained that the lamplighters would all be put out of work! These days, most people don't even know what a lamplighter is.

Likewise, in the future, we will develop new ways of creating value in our economy that will be rewarded appropriately.

There are some who see business as a zero-sum pursuit, but that is not the case so long as we have economic growth. So long as we can continue to "grow the pie," we can continue to reap the boon of the positive-sum game of wealth creation.

Naval Ravikant takes the stance that, "We can all be wealthy," citing the incredible increases in quality of life between now and renaissance Europe.

I take this stance as well. 

And, while there are downsides to the ever-increasing technologization of our daily lives, it seems that this trend is not going to reverse any time soon.

So, if you can't beat them, join them.

I'm working on virtual reality as I believe that there is an exciting future.

Virtual reality has been shown to be "the great equalizer"
Much like the role of the arquebus in warfare, I believe that VR is going to make computing even more accessible than in the past.

Augmented reality will make its mark as well, but in a world where all of our physical needs are taken care of, and the digital realm is more and more lifelike, why bother with the physical realm at all?
Again, this can be seen as bleak or exciting, depending. 

But it seems to me that mankind has an incredible ability to adapt. 
Our environment has changed again and again and yet we still find a way to laugh, cry, fight, mend, reap, and reproduce.

We've
