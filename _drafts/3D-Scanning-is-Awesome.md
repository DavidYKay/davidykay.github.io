title: 3D Scanning is Awesome
---

The early adopters in the room are way ahead of me, but 


Imagine that -- we can now spent a few hundred dollars and have the ability to capture 3D models of anything you point your iPad at!


At hackathons in the past, I've taken advantage of 3D printing
for:
    * [mechanical parts on a robotic beer keg](robokeg)
    * [custom braces / casts for astronauts](Mediprint)
    
But the actuality of standing around in the apartment and scanning myself was pretty darn cool.

It's kind of like the scene in Tron where he gets scanned into the computer system via the high-power laser.


Chime in: do you have any great ideas for using a 3D scanner?
