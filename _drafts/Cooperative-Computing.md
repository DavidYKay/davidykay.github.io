# The Vision

As we know, [Software is eating the world][6].

However, there's a huge [talent shortage][7], which means that the best-funded firms aren't able to hire as quickly as they would like, and the less-well-funded firms are forced to settle for less capable talent. To make matters worse, the [tools][10] we are using aren't maximizing the effectiveness of our meager human brains.

So, what to do?

As with any problem, there are many potential solutions. For example, I have visions of a virtual reality visual programming environment which could reduce the barrier to programming, but I'm concerned that concept is a bit too far ahead of the market right now. 

## Microservices

Instead, embracing the distributed systems / [microservices][13] trend is a more aptly-timed approach to enhancing developer productivity.

Indeed, thanks to this movement spearheaded by [Jeff Bezos][9], the world [increasingly implements][12] a service-oriented architecture. 

The core reason is simple: coordinating large groups of humans is [impossibly][17] [difficult][16]; it's far easier to use networked programming interfaces as a means of communication. Those are, at least in theory, better-documented and more consistently-behaved than a handshake or a written agreement between two parties.

## Globalization

Chairman Mao once [wrote][15], "Let a hundred flowers bloom; let a hundred schools of thought contend." Though he was speaking of political discourse, the future of our industry looks much the same. 
The plummeting cost of communication and coordination and the rise of tools to aid in technology (AWS, open source, et al.) and small business (Stripe, Stripe Atlas, et al.) mean that there is more opportunity than ever for small players to shake things up.

Yes, there is a fear that our future is entirely an AI future, dominated by the data warehouses of the tech giants, but it's hard for me to imagine that this will always be the case. The giants have ALWAYS had an edge in funding and manpower and yet consistently fall flat-footed. Will data-as-firepower make this so different? We shall see.

Let's pretend for a moment that this giant-take-all scenario does not happen. Power, knowledge, and innovation will become increasingly distributed. The hegemony of America and Silicon Valley will continue to slowly erode as other innovators rise. 

We're already seeing this. China, originally dismissed as a great force of "globalization," but not "innovation," is now generating real breakthroughs, most notably in [facial recognition][3]. And, given the insane [hardware iteration speed in Shenzhen][5], I suspect we will see that trend continue. 

Every major city of the world now has a co-working space, programming classes, and usually, a dev bootcamp. Nairobi may never rival San Francisco, but the wheels are in motion and have been for several years now. Could the next John Carmack come from outside the US?

Skeptical? Consider the general trend of biological and human systems: we begin with anarchy. Or, in the case of programming, individual programmers. Communication and coordination are very costly. Then, a king/Microsoft gathers a huge mindshare of subjects/developers to build great works and enforce the rule of law. As communication/coordination becomes cheaper, wealth becomes more distributed and we see the rise of an aristocracy / "bazaar"-style open-source projects such as Linux and Apache. With the advent of Git, we move to a branch & fork, "horizontal gene transfer" model of GitHub, or a "democratic" government in the political example. Credit for this concept goes to Dr. Gavin Wood who describes this very eloquently in his [talk][14].

As an American, I'll admit I'm sad to think we'll lose our dominance, but, let me remind you that everyone will be innovating more quickly if there is a global dialogue of computation. This may feel uncomfortable. After all, it's human nature to prefer a larger slice of a smaller pie, but it's better for our civilization to focus on growing the pie. 

But, take a step outside of yourself for a moment. Imagine for a moment that you are not solely concerned with the well-being of one body.

Of course, 

## Tooling

The barrier is rapidly becoming our tooling. Computing hasn't changed much in [30+ years][11]. Text-based, operating system-enabled programming has been around for more than 50 years. That is, modern programmers could be warped back to the 1960s and placed in front of a teletype, and be comfortable and familiar with the tooling with a minimal amount of training! 

We like to brag about how quickly our industry moves compared to others, but the truth is that the fundamentals haven't changed much in a long, long time. Likewise, I'd bet that th

However, our current computing tools won't get us there.

A flock of starlings is our model for the future of computing:

In order to make this happen, we'll need to improve the state-of-the-art in distributed systems and networked computing.

## Cooperative Computing

It's a shame that somebody else already has the domain (and, presumably, the copyright), because ["cooperative computing"][1] would have been a great buzzword for this.

# The Ask

Of course, every grand vision is rooted in the humblest of beginnings.

Our ask is 

We're working on a concept in API design. 

# Credentials

I've worked on the DoubleClick API team at Google, have been CTO, and recently turned down an offer from the Apple Siri team to pursue this startup.

Please put me in touch with anyone you might know who is currently pursuing API development or building atop a legacy system. Even if there's no client relationship to be had,

I'm bootstrapping a new business in the field of API development and opening up access to legacy systems.
