title: My Spiritual Journey
---

I've lived most of my life in this manner.

In fact, when I was around 12 years old, I dropped out of my confirmation class.

We had just begun reciting [catechisms][1], an act of profession of faith.

For example, 

> 1. What is the chief end of man?
> A. Manâ€™s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy him forever.

The experience left an awful taste in my mouth, as I was still wrestling with my own religious beliefs.

Never one to follow blindly along with the rest of the group, I ended up dropping out of the confirmation class.

I've dabbled with religion since, but have often run against the grain of organized religion. For example, I attended my cousin's church a few years ago on Thanksgiving weekend, when a visiting reverend came in to run the service. He had spent over a decade in the middle east converting muslims to Christianity, and spent the morning speaking out against Islam and upholding Christianity as the One True Faith.

Appalled, I never went back to church.

I've been working with a life coach recently, and we explored the idea of getting back in touch with my spirituality. 

I opened up the New Testament again, but once again found myself distracted
