title: Setting up your Programming Environment
---

In order to start programming, I recommend three different tools:

* Command prompt / Terminal emulator
* Text editor
* Compiler or Interpreter

We'll be using Python

## Linux

* Terminal emulator - probably already installed
* Text editor - I like Vim, but you probably want to start with Gedit, Kate, or Atom.
* Compiler or Interpreter - Python

## Windows

* Terminal emulator - Powershell is pretty good
* Text editor - I recommend Atom or VSCode.
* Compiler or Interpreter - Python

## Mac

* Terminal emulator - iTerm
* Text editor - I recommend Atom or VSCode.
* Compiler or Interpreter - Python
