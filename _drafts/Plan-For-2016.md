title: Plan for 2016
---

This is more of a January-esque post than anything else, but I finally got around to replying to an email from friend of mine (sorry, Brent!)

Short term: 
* Close first sale on the pharmacy software I'm working on. 
* Start hosting dinner parties / social events to grow/fortify my network in Vancouver. 
* Find a good ongoing contract that I enjoy and also pays decently.
* Landmark Forum - Yep, some people call it a cult or accuse them of being linked to the Church of Scientology, but I'm convinced that I should do it. I just signed up for late May.

Long term:
* Get 5 customers on the Pharmacy software
* Blog at least monthly about health tech
* Keep rollerblading / swimming / staying active

End-of-year:
* 2 weeks vacation in SE Asia 

Its good to have a plan. 

As Yogi Berra once said, "If you don't know where you are going, you'll end up someplace else."

Where are you going?
