title: Emacs For Life
---

Friends know that I am a long-time Vimmer, but I've recently made the transition to Emacs and I gotta say: holy crap, I've been missing out.

For me, the missing piece was comfort with Lisp. Once I had that (by way of Clojure), Emacs was a complete revelation. I honestly can't imagine using anything else at this point.

Amazing that the core of the thing was built in a one-day marathon pairing session between Richard Stallman and Guy Steele.

The thing truly is a work of alien technology.

There are tons of haters, but you gotta try it. Seriously.

I was skeptical when I saw Steve Yegge refer to it as the "100-year editor," but I'm beginning to realize that he was right.
