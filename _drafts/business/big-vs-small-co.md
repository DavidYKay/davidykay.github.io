Hi SAN,

I’m seeking some guidance about my next potential career move.

Just a bit about my current situation. I am at a large company and I’ve been in my current role as a business analyst for 11 months. To me, I still consider myself to be relatively new to the role since I’ve had no prior experience related to the role. I can see that my efforts are being recognized and that there are plans to support my growth in the company. I have a better understanding of what is expected from my role and I’m finally getting into the groove of things.

Recently, I was approached by an ex-colleague to join him at a small company (when I say small, it’s extremely small) which has the backing of a large parent company. What they’re offering is the opportunity to essentially grow the company from the ground up. The new role is a business analyst position and due to the size of it, it’s been made clear that I’ll be doing various other tasks around the business.

My current dilemma revolves around a few thoughts
1. Job security from a small company. My concern is that due to the size, I am afraid it may go bust.

2. Remuneration doesn’t quite compensate for the risk and amount of work that is expected from the role.

3. Learning opportunity. Despite being in the role for 11 months, I feel that there is still a lot that I can learn about my role in my current company whereas at the smaller company I would be learning about my role on my own and there is a greater exposure to different sides of the business that I would not have in my current role.

4. My ability. Even though my ex-colleague has faith in me ability, I do not feel confident that my current experience will be enough for them and I may be let go. This particular issue is a big one for me.

I hope there are people out there who has had a similar situation or who has been at a large and small company and can tell me what they liked/disliked or can tell me whether my thoughts are valid.

========================================

1. Job security: 

IMO, this is the least important of the factors. If you're always doing a great job, you'll always be employable. You have much more control over this than you may think.

2. Risk/reward:

You're absolutely right. The early employees in a company have to work MUCH harder than the late ones. If you don't feel you're getting a large upside, then this is a legitimate concern.

3. Learning opportunity:

I believe this is the most important factor of the four. Early in your career, it's generally considered best to maximize for learning.

Naval Ravikant of AngelList likes to recommend that young people start off in big companies and then gradually work in smaller and smaller firms, taking on more and more responsibility with less and less structure.

Look inside yourself and consider whether you are enjoying the large company environment or whether you feel that it is stifling. Different people have different preferences. At different times in their careers. Trust your gut.

4. Ability:

I suspect that this is in your head. We are generally our own worst critics. If he believes in you, and YOU believe in yourself, you can do it. The question is: do you believe in yourself? Do you feel ready?

If not, there's no shame on passing. There will be other startups. Then again, there will always be a big corporate job. :)

Good luck.

P.S. I tried the big company thing and hated it. I got the hell out as soon as I could. I know some lifers who have worked there since graduation. Different strokes for different folks.
