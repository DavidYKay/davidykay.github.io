## The Vision

[Software is eating the world][6], Moore's law [continues][18], and quantum computing is getting [closer to primetime][19]. With this incredible progress before us, it's hard not to feel the future is bright.

However, techno-optimism is not the only nararative in town. The pitfall in the tech industry that gets the most airtime is the colossal [talent shortage][7]. The best-funded firms aren't able to hire as quickly as they would like, and the less-well-funded firms are forced to settle for less-capable talent. 

A critical issue that few people like to discuss is that the [tools][10] we are using aren't maximizing the effectiveness of our meager human brains.

Critics may wonder: "Who cares? You technology geeks are the only ones who care about this stuff."

I counter that technology's tendrils extend far beyond Silicon Valley, Facebook addiction, and the latest iDevice. Much of our economy, all the way down to the average retirement plan, is [dependent on exponential technological growth][8].

If we, the technologists, aren't able to keep up the pace, there are a lot of people who will be left out in the cold.

Thankfully, there are many organizations and individuals dedicated to closing the talent gap, primarily through new efforts in [education][23], [diversity][24], and [recruiting][1].

### Globalization

Chairman Mao once [wrote][15], "Let a hundred flowers bloom; let a hundred schools of thought contend." Though he was speaking of political discourse, the future of our industry looks much the same. 
The plummeting cost of communication and coordination (Git, Slack) and the rise of tools to aid in technology (AWS, open source) and small business (Stripe, Stripe Atlas) mean that there is more opportunity than ever for small players to shake things up.

Yes, there is a fear that our future is entirely an AI future, dominated by the data warehouses of the tech giants, but it's hard for me to imagine that this will always be the case. The giants have ALWAYS had an edge in funding and manpower and yet somehow find a way to fall flat-footed. Will data-as-firepower make this so different? We shall see.

Let's pretend for a moment that this giant-take-all scenario does not happen. Power, knowledge, and innovation will become increasingly distributed. The hegemony of America and Silicon Valley will continue to slowly erode as other innovators rise. 

We're already seeing this. China, originally dismissed as a great force of "globalization," but not "innovation," is now generating real breakthroughs, most notably in [facial recognition][3]. And, given the insane [hardware iteration speed in Shenzhen][5], I suspect we will see that trend continue. 

Every major city of the world now has a co-working space, programming classes, and usually, a dev bootcamp. Nairobi may never rival San Francisco, but the wheels are in motion and have been for several years now. Could the next John Carmack come from outside the US?

### Selflessness

As an American, I'll admit I'm sad to think we'll lose our dominance, but, let me remind you that everyone will be innovating more quickly if there is a truly global dialogue of computation. This may feel uncomfortable. After all, it's human nature to prefer a larger slice of a smaller pie, but it's better for our civilization if we can move beyond the ["crab bucket"][21] mentality. 

But, take a step outside of yourself for a moment. Imagine for a moment that you are not solely concerned with the well-being of one body.

Of course, 

### Decentralization

Skeptical? Consider the general trend of biological and human systems. (Software parallels in parenthesis).

1. All systems begin in **anarchy** (individual programmers, working in isolation). Communication and coordination are very costly. 

2. Then, a **king** (Microsoft) gathers a huge mindshare of subjects (developers) to build great works and enforce the rule of law. 

3. As communication/coordination becomes cheaper, wealth becomes more distributed and we see the rise of an **aristocracy** ("bazaar"-style open-source projects such as Linux and Apache). 

4. With the advent of the cheaper communication such as the telegraph (Git), we move to a **democratic** system (branch & fork, "horizontal gene transfer" collaboration model). 

Please see Dr. Gavin Wood's [talk][14] where he explains this concept far more compellingly than I.

### Tools

Personally, I'm most attracted to the idea of improving our tools. 

Steve Jobs once [likened][25] the personal computer to a "bicycle" for the mind. And it has changed the face of virtually every human discipline.

What saddens me is that most of us are content to ride fixies when we could be racing Ferraris!

One would think that computer programmers would be 

As they say, "the cobbler's children always go barefoot."

#### There Will be Code

While some argue, "Why bother? Code will soon go away completely," I subscribe to the Bob Martin school of thought, which states, no matter how far the level of abstraction rises (emphasis mine):

> We will never be rid of code, because **code** represents the details of the **requirements**. At some level those details cannot be ignored or abstracted; they have to be **specified**. And specifying requirements in such detail that a machine can execute them is programming. Such a specification is code.

Some fascinating ideas include the idea of using [Machine Learning for Programming][20].

Yann LeCun's team has done some impressive work on deep learning for this purpose, placing a basic Turing machine inside of a reinforcement learning environment until it learns basic algorithms. 

As with any problem, there are many potential solutions. For example, I can envision a virtual reality programming environment which could reduce the barrier to programming, but I'm concerned that concept is a bit too far ahead of the market right now. 

### Microservices

Instead, embracing the distributed systems / [microservices][13] trend seems a more aptly-timed approach to enhancing developer productivity.

Indeed, thanks to this movement spearheaded by [Jeff Bezos][9], the world [increasingly implements][12] a service-oriented architecture. 

The core reason is simple: coordinating large groups of humans is [impossibly][17] [difficult][16]; it's far easier to use networked programming interfaces as a means of communication/coordination. APIs are, at least in theory, better-documented and more consistently-behaved than a handshake or a written agreement between two parties.

### Tooling

The barrier is rapidly becoming our tooling. Computing hasn't changed much in [30+ years][11]. Text-based, operating system-enabled programming has been around for more than 50 years. That is, modern programmers could be warped back to the 1960s and placed in front of a teletype, and be comfortable and familiar with the tooling with a minimal amount of training! 

We like to brag about how quickly our industry moves compared to others, but the truth is that the fundamentals haven't changed much in a long, long time. Likewise, I'd bet that th

However, our current computing tools won't get us there.

A flock of starlings is my model for the future of computing:

In order to make this happen, we'll need to improve the state-of-the-art in distributed systems and networked computing.

## The Ask

Though I speak in lofty terms about the future of computing, every grand vision is rooted in the humblest of beginnings. Every wall starts with a single brick.

I'm currently building a cohort of early clients for this concept.

My ask: please put me in touch with anyone in need of help with API development. Those building atop a legacy system go to the front of the queue. 

Every system is a [legacy system][22] the day it ships. My dream is to help these systems to stay useful and relevant for many years of dutiful service.

Let's build a future
