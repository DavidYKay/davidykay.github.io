I grew up as a fairly stereotypical sedentary nerd, clueless about diet and exercise. I've spent the last few years reversing that. 

Lately, I've become quite the fitness nut: resistance training, calorie counting, and inline skating have become cornerstones of my life.

I'm a certified skate instructor and I enjoy filming and editing [skate videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC3faUkMJXo&list=PLGxmb2F67Kd7Nw_EQm1cNWdQhYOs0rmz6). Disclaimer: I'm still working my way up to stunts.

I also write a [blog on inline skating](http://www.thecityskater.com/). Silly? Perhaps. But it's my first blog to actually have an audience.
