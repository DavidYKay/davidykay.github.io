## Summary

I focus on building usable and useful mobile apps in the healthcare industry.

I've been developing mobile apps since 2008, including for Deutsche Bank, 1-800-GOT-JUNK, and Otsuka Medical.

I've served as founding CTO of two startup companies and have experience leading large teams in high-pressure environments, including a rush job for an appearance on Shark Tank.

## Past Work

Check out my [hackathon presentations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXJhioQfUAc&list=PL87766F627E9999C0&index=7) for a good showcase of my personality and ability to whip things up in 24 hours.

My [corporate website](http://www.gargoyle.co/) showcases some of my past work, plus some interview vids of me.

My [StatusChart](https://www.statuschart.com/davidykay) has a fairly complete list of my work since 2011.

These days, my blogging takes place on this site. So, please take a second to [check out my writing](/).
