title: Productivity Hacks - Brain.FM 
---

I'll admit that I've been sitting on this one for a while now, but it's one of the most helpful tools I employ to enter the [flow state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)).

If you accept the premise that sound and music can affect your state of mind (babbling brook vs NYC traffic, anyone?), then it stands to reason that someone could compose music specially designed to promote a certain **neurological response** by the brain.

[Brain.fm](https://www.brain.fm/) is a streaming music service founded on this principle.

Select Focus, Relax, or Sleep, and Brain.fm will queue up tunes that have been verified in a lab to produce the corresponding brain wave patterns in your head!

Strap on your headphones for best results.
