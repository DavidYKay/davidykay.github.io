Dear friends, 

After much [deliberation](//Comfort-With-Ambiguity/), I've decided to **decline** the [offer from Apple](../images/2017/05/AcceptingTheCall/offer.pdf).

Let it be known that I feel fear. Walking away from risk-free money is never an easy thing.

On the other hand, I feel more _alive_ than ever!

Will I look back on this day in regret? I think not. 

While many others would kill for a $300K offer at Apple, re-reading [The Alchemist](http://amzn.to/2rgOW4x) this weekend gave me the conviction to acknowledge who I am and what I'm meant for.

To [paraphrase](http://paulgraham.com/13sentences.html) Paul Graham, "the worst kind of distractions are the ones that pay you money." 

A stack of money is a very seductive thing. Enough to make many give up their dreams.

This is the day when I take full responsibility for my life.

No more sitting in the passenger's seat.

No more playing the victim.

No more blaming anxiety or demons.

We all have our struggles. It's been said that 96% of people come from from dysfunctional families. We can decide to let our past determine our future, or we can take full ownership and be completely alive and self-expressed in the present. I know which one I'm choosing.

To my friends, family, and indeed the entire human race: thanks for your support and kinship through this incredible time in my life. I look forward to paying it back in dividends.

The road ahead is long and difficult, but I wouldn't have it any other way.
