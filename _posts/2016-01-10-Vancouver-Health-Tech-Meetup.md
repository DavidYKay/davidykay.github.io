title: Vancouver Health Tech Meetup
---

In order to get the new year started on the right note, I'd like to announce the founding of the [Vancouver Health Tech Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Vancouver-Health-Tech-Meetup/)!

I founded this group because, while [HxD Vancouver](http://www.meetup.com/HXD-Vancouver/) is excellent, Vancouver is lacking a true tech-oriented healthcare meetup.

So, if you're a medical professional, entrepreneur, or technologist who believes in the power of technology to improve healthcare, this group is for you!

Things are in the early stages right now, but I'm hoping to host a monthly event which highlights how healthcare providers, med device / pharma companies, and startups are using technology in their work.

Intermittently, to augment the main event, we can hold:

* Workshops, to educate our members on how to wield technology in their work.
* Hackathons, to gather multi-disciplinary teams of to execute on real-world healthcare problems.
* Parties / networking events, so that we can better get to know one another.

I have other ideas, but I think this is a good starting place. Suggestions are welcome. :)

If this sounds good, please join!

If this doesn't sound good, but you have suggestions on how to improve it, say so!

Looking forward to building a great community with you.

-David
