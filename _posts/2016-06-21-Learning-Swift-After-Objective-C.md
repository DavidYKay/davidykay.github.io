title: What's the Best Way to Learn Swift if I Already Know Objective-C?
---

Swift! Heralded by some as the best thing since sliced bread, Swift is Apple's replacement for Objective-C.

If you've been using Objective-C at work but are curious to learn Swift, the best way I've found is through through practice, practice, practice.

Yes, yes, I know: a cliched, unhelpful response.

If you're looking for learning resources, the resources I recommend are:

1. This [Swift tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/115253/swift-2-tutorial-a-quick-start) on RayWenderlich.com

2. The [Official Swift Language Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html)

3. [We Heart Swift](https://www.weheartswift.com/), a community site dedicated to Swift-based iOS tutorials.

Please let me know if you are having trouble or if this solves your problem!
