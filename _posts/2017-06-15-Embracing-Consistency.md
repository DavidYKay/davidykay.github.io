title: Embracing Consistency
---

I recently read a book called [The Art of Persistence](http://amzn.to/2sFBkTG), which reminded me of a simple, yet powerful idea: that consistency is the most important factor in success.

In my body recomposition efforts to cut fat and gain muscle, I never achieved great results until I started to treat the process like a marathon rather than a sprint, a daily practice rather than a concentrated effort.

Likewise, the great writers of our time often have a near-religious devotion to their [daily work habits][2].

> "I write only when inspiration strikes. Fortunately it strikes every morning at nine o'clock sharp."

I know that to achieve my dreams as an entrepreneur, I'll need to master both consistency and the art of written communication. 

However, I'll admit I haven't been making great progress in either department.

Going forward, I'm going to publish at least one line of either prose or code, every day. Day-to-day, I share a lot of meaningful thoughts with those close to me, but I don't usually take the time to type them out here. No longer.

In the past, I let my own perfectionism and lack of self-esteem prevent me from sharing these thoughts with you all, but I'd like to change that. By practicing the art of creating value, I hope to gain a deeper connection with you, my readers, and the act itself of creating small chunks of thought for consumption by others.

Consider this me finally embracing the philosophy of [quantity over quality][1]. 

Thanks for being my partner in this venture.
