title: 7-week Class on Programming Fundamentals with Python
---

Have you ever wanted to learn programming but never got around to it?

Perhaps you can set aside a few hours each week to learn the fundamentals of programming?

If so, I'm leading a group class on programming for absolute beginners. There's an **online** class as well as an in-person class in **Vancouver**, BC.

The class meets once a week for seven weeks, and by the end of it, you'll have learned the fundamentals of computer progamming using the popular and powerful [Python programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)).

Each week, you'll have a homework assignment that should take you 2-5 hours to complete. I've done my best to make these problems as interesting, fun, and real-worldy as possible. Look through the list of assignments to get a feeling for what you'll get to learn.

For advanced students and those desiring a challenge, I'll also assign a bonus problem every week that will stretch your understanding and mastery. 

Remember, you can do this regardless of whether you consider yourself bad at math or "tech-unsavvy."
Learning is a process that you [can master](http://www.amazon.com/dp/039916524X/ref=r_soa_w_d).
The important thing is that you show up and chip away at your learning, bit by bit, day after day.

My job is to make things interesting and digestible, so as long as you can dedicate yourself to chewing, swallowing, and digesting, you'll be able to solve real problems in no time!

## Future Courses

After learning the fundamentals, the whole world of computing will open up to you.

Most students will want to continue directly on to [Web Programming in Python](/Intro-to-Web-Programming-With-Python), but I'm also putting together courses on several other topics. 

Please indicate your interest by clicking the appropriate link:

* [Intro to Hardware Prototyping / Internet of Things](/Internet-of-Things-With-Python)
* [Intro to Browser Programming in Clojurescript](/Intro-to-Browser-Programming-With-Clojurescript)
* [Intro to Data Science](/Intro-to-Data-Science-with-Python)
* [Intro to Game Programming](/Intro-to-Game-Programming)

## Thanks!

I'm honored at the opportunity to teach you. I've taught the fundamentals to two individuals in the past, both of whom have gone on to get great tech jobs in San Francisco. Perhaps you'll be next? :)
