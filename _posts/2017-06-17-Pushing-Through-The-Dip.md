title: Pushing Through The Dip
---

[Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/), a wise man, sheds some light on quitting versus sticking it out in his book, [The Dip](http://amzn.to/2rsjhge).

The book's core argument is that any worthwhile pursuit in life starts out fun and exciting, but, after the initial novelty wears off, becomes challenging, discouraging, and even boring for a LONG while before you can emerge out on the other side, competent and truly enjoying the fruits of your labors. He has aptly named this long slog, "**The Dip**."

You can think of Seth's book as the "what to expect" guide for putting in your [10,000 hours](http://amzn.to/2sLgjaB).

In terms of my energy level and dedication to my daily habits (including writing this blog), I'm in one heck of a mini-dip right now! A friend brought me out on his sailboat all day today and I hadn't thought that A. I'd be such a lousy sailor and B. I'd be so drained by the time I got home. Nothing sounds better than vegging out right now.

However, in the name of [keeping my word](http://www.davidkay.cc/Embracing-Consistency/), I'm doing what I can to not [break the chain](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret). 

Publishing an small / less-insightful post like this one hurts my inner perfectionist, but I'm learning to see life as a marathon rather than a sprint.

After all, taking one step is better than none, no? Even if this post fails to connect with anyone, the habit of always moving the ball forward seems to have a deeply powerful psychological effect.

So, I ask you: is there something that you're not moving forward on? Something that matters to you that you're waiting for "inspiration to strike" before you begin?

What are you afraid of?
