title: The Dollar Collapse
---

I wanted to take a quick moment to let you know that if you are not already taking precautions against the collapse of the Dollar and/or increased [currency controls][4] on the USD, I suggest you take action immediately.

I've been moving a significant chunk of my funds into cryptocurrency and precious metals. 

There may be better investments, but these are the ones that I am personally emphasizing.

If you do move forward with exchanging your USD into a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, I strongly suggest that you use [offline/cold storage][2]. A [hardware wallet][1] is generally considered a convenient cold storage method.

Why cold storage? Apart from ordinary security concerns, I foresee a future where the stewards of the USD become threatened by the rise of cryptocurrency and take drastic measures to control its use, similar to [1933][3].

In the modern day, rather than the seizure of gold, I think we may instead see services such as Coinbase, which hold cryptocurrency assets on one's behalf, co-opted or coerced by government in order to reduce threats to the Dollar. In other words, if you leave your Bitcoin stash in Coinbase, it's feasible that, in a crisis, you may be prevented from moving that money back out.

Regardless of your approach, I suggest taking action. Our economy is in free-fall and the "best" answer we seem to have is inflation.
