Happy New Year!!!

I'm a big believer in the power of calorie counting to achieve fat loss and muscle gain.

Since it's the time of year to set resolutions and buy gym memberships, I put together a handy [Nutrition Calculator](http://www.davidykay.com/gadgets/nutrition/) for anyone who might be looking to cut a little bit of weight during the coming year.

The formulas are taken from [John Romaniello's blog](http://romanfitnesssystems.com/articles/calorie-calculations-for-body-recompositioning/). For those unfamiliar with Roman, he's a nerdy fitness guru. His books and coaching were immensely helpful for me when I was beginning my fitness journey. Definitely check him out if you are just getting started.

For the programmers in the audience, here's the [source code](https://github.com/DavidYKay/nutrition-calculator).

Have a fit and prosperous new year!
