title: Learning CIDER - Jacking into the REPL
---

At Clojure/west last week, something that came up is how difficult Emacs and CIDER are for newbies. This is a damn shame, as CIDER is one of the most productive environments I've ever used.

My hope is to help the newbie ramp-up process by providing newbie-oriented screencasts on the topic.

Here's the first one:

Please share it with any Clojure newbies in your network.

And let me know if you have any suggestions on topics/format/etc.

Thanks!
