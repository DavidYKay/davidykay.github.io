title: Non-suicide Pledge
---

I pledge to never kill myself. If I am found dead and it is ruled to be a suicide, then you will know that I have been murdered.

God willing, this post will never bear fruit.

You have my word that I will take every effort to ensure that my work will outlive me. And that I will do my best to ensure that each risk I take is prudent.

I hope that when you read this, you will see this as a reminder to live life to its fullest and to never bow to tyrants.

We are capable of much more than we think.

Love,
David
