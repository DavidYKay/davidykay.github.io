I'm a bit of an odd duck. Half-Korean, half-Australian, I've attended Quaker school, lived in China, dropped out of college, sold car parts, and been a professional DJ.

The best way to get a feel for my personality is probably by scoping out my [YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/user/davidykay). Or stalking me the other major social channels.

While you're at it, here's an old [personal blog](http://onlyplateaus.com/). Haven't touched it in a while, but I like to accumulate "life lessons learned" here.

I also love to cook! If I could find the time, I'd have a lot of fun writing a food blog. But there are only so many hours in the day. The food blog must wait.
