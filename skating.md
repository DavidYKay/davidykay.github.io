I'm a certified skate instructor and am an active member of the Empire Skate Club of New York.

Outside of skating, I'm quite the fitness nut: resistance training and nutrition are a big part of my life. 

Training is enjoyable, but skating is just such a gas! There are few things that compare to the thrill of rolling around outdoors with friends, testings one's limits.

When I have the time, I enjoy filming and editing skate videos. Here are some of my [street skating videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC3faUkMJXo&list=PLGxmb2F67Kd7Nw_EQm1cNWdQhYOs0rmz6), but lately I've been more focused on learning aggressive / skatepark skating. I'm documenting progress in a series I call "[DK Learns Aggressive](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYZJq-Wn4ntWwbAdXKbSDucUzDvlv0jDz)."
