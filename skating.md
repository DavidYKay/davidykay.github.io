I'm a certified skate instructor and am an active member of the Empire Skate Club of New York.

Outside of skating, I'm quite the fitness nut: resistance training and nutrition are a big part of my life. 

Training is enjoyable, but skating is just such a gas! There are few things that compare to the thrill of rolling around outdoors with friends, testings one's limits.

When I have the time, I enjoy filming and editing [skate videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC3faUkMJXo&list=PLGxmb2F67Kd7Nw_EQm1cNWdQhYOs0rmz6). 

I also write a [blog on inline skating](http://www.thecityskater.com/).
