Classically trained on the piano, David Y. Kay later moved into jazz, seeing it as a "master key" to music. 

Growing up listening to motown, rock, hip hop, folk music, and electronica, David has an eclectic taste that he likes to bring to bear during live performances.

As mentioned in the song lyric, "I've heard there was a secret chord that David played and it pleased the Lord," David believes deeply in the healing power of musical frequencies and likes to use alternative musical tunings to heighten the effect of his performances.

Despite dabbling with other instruments, David mainly focuses on keyboards and vocals.

David has performed for audiences in Vancouver, BC, Spokane, WA, Sandpoint, ID, and in the Flathead Valley, MT.
