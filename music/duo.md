David's current duo partner is Barnyard Swim.

Barnyard Swim has few who can rival his excellence on the electric guitar, yet is still humble enough to play a mean bass guitar and/or stomp box when the situation calls for it.

Barnyard Swim brings an energy and intensity to each show uncommon to duo acts, and his background in blues and rock helps to add extra edge and variety to performances.
