## Music

I enjoy singing, songwriting, and playing the piano. I've performed in Vancouver, BC, Sandpoint, ID, and in the Flathead Valley, MT.

## Skating

I'm formerly a certified skate instructor and am an active member of the Empire Skate Club of New York.

Though I currently don't often do so, I have enjoyed filming and editing skate videos:

I have a small [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAapqYPL92GOMU-ecHblmHQ) dedicated to rollerblading.

Here are some of my [street skating videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYZJq-Wn4ntVHzC-L89ygoMcRe2OlkZyz), but in later years, I was been more focused on learning aggressive / skatepark skating. I've documented my progress in a series I call "[DK Learns Aggressive](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYZJq-Wn4ntWwbAdXKbSDucUzDvlv0jDz)."

## Militia

Mastery of arms is important to the security of a free state. As such, I am involved in training small unit tactics.
