<p>
Mankind is becoming ever integrated with technology.
</p>

<p>
Moore's law is relentless and visions of a "technological singularity" seem more compelling, year by year.
</p>

<p>
And yet, our progress towards that future is uneven and often faltering;
how distressing it is that our medical knowledge is still full of holes!
</p>

<p>
As a computer programmer and entrepreneur, my hope is to wield technology in the fight to achieve true mastery of human biology.
